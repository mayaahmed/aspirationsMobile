<h3> Chapter 16  </h3>
<h2>The Return to America </h2>

<p> Arti bought jasmine flower garlands ever day. Jasmine flower
garlands was one of the  reason Arti had wanted to come back
to  India. She had  missed Jasmine  flowers. Arti  and Kabir
also visited a lot  of spiritual places. The temples somehow
felt live and real as though gods really lived there. </p>

<p> "So many major religions of the world originated in India" said
Arti. "Every one can experience spirituality here." </p>

<p> "The place seems spiritual because the people are so" said Kabir. </p>

<p> The couple visited many temples where people went to make wishes come
true.  Arti had no desire to make wishes.  She was happy to be there
at that moment of time in a temple. On the one hand one could wish for
the world and on the other one could wish for nothing. Arti realized
that it made no difference. This was her land. She belonged
here. Everything made sense. The Indian life made her happy. </p>

<p> There was a little remorse of the innocence she had lost in her
travels. The poverty of India jarred now that Arti was more aware of
it after her travels.  Looking around India, a question repeated in
Arti's mind. Why were the lives of so many people so harsh? It was
just a matter of fate that she was not one of those. </p>

<p> "India's poverty is pathological" said Arti. "It is not normal for any
country to be so poor. Of course there is the British factor but I do
not see why things are in such a state. Isn't it strange that we have
divided the society so clearly into the haves and have nots? What
strikes me most is that the poor people do not seem real to me. It is
like I have shut myself from thinking about them. Is that the way we
can go on with life without becoming morbid?"  </p>

<p> "That is kind of true" replied Kabir. "The poor people live within
themselves as a group.  They behave to people outside the group
differently. If they see a rich person they either want to extract
money from them or be extra nice to prove that they may be poor but
can be quite generous."  </p>

<p> "All societies are fundamentally feudal and the people from a certain
class keep to themselves" said Arti. </p>

<p> "Seems to be so" agreed Kabir. </p>

<p> "I am not sure I am not guilty. For some reason, I have a feeling that
I am a part of all this economic exploitation" said Arti. </p>

<p>  Time and  again  Arti  felt that  a  way to  contribute
towards  eradication  of  poverty  was by  sharing  personal
wealth. Not to a  charity institution but directly towards a
cause. Personal  involvement or what some  people would call
getting your  hands dirty was  the only way to  get results.
But she  was still a  student that too without  any funding.
All noble causes had to wait for now. </p>

<p> Moreover, the Indian society was going through a conflict
period.  Every time there was a street fight between people of two
different communities the whole country would be dragged in. There
would be riots. Houses would burn and people would get killed. </p>

<p> "Do not go today to visit your parents" said Kabir. "Bangalore is
volatile at this point. There was some stone throwing at the bus
stop." </p>

<p> Arti was disappointed. </p>

<p> "What happened?" asked Arti. </p>

<p> "Two young people had a motorcycle accident and the fight percolated"
said Kabir. </p>

<p> "I really hate being dragged in to a fight relating to a motorcycle
accident that has nothing to do with me" said Arti really irritated. </p>

<p> That was the rule. You were dragged in to all kinds of fights and your
plans would get disrupted. Arti began to miss America. There were no
conflicts in America. Moreover Sharma left India and Arti had no one
to work with. America was hiring big time because the economy was
booming. Kabir kept getting job offers from America all the time. Arti
and Kabir realized that they had moved back to India a little
early. Arti should have finished her PhD and Kabir should have
accumulated enough money to buy a good house. The inevitable
happened. Soon Kabir got a job offer he could not refuse. The couple
flew back to America, a land where all dreams came true quite easily. </p>
