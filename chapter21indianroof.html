<h3> Chapter 21  </h3>
<h2>The Return of Dreams  </h2>


<p> Arti started taking classes in metal work. Metallurgy was difficult
work. It was thrilling to design a part on the computer and then to
see a CNC machine bring that drawing to life. Arti was witnessing
human brain at its best. </p>

<p>  "Cutting metal is difficult" Arti told her mother on the phone. "The
speeds and feeds of the cutter has to be exact. Until I worked with metal
I did not know how challenging it was." </p>

<p>  "My daughter is cutting metal while I can only cut vegetables" Arti's
mother said proudly. </p>

<p>  "You have not lived until you have learned welding" said Arti. "My
education was not complete till now. These classes are absolutely
necessary for me to call myself educated." </p>

<p>  "Be careful" advised her mother. </p>

<p> Arti loved the smell of the workshop. </p>

<p> "You like the smell of cutting fluids?" asked Kabir. "What happened
to your perfumed world?" </p>

<p> "There happens to be a new fragrance I like" said Arti
laughing.  </p>

<p> Arti also traveled to India and watched her father recover.  For
months after the operation Arti's father had been bed ridden. But
slowly he started walking around the house. Arti's mother was overtly
cautious. But when Arti was around, her father took more chances. Soon
he was well and could do everything on his own again. It was nothing
less than a miracle. </p>

<p> The trips to India made because of her father's illness made Arti
realize that to be happy she needed India in her life again. It was
different from her first return to India. Then her Indian soil content
dominated. But now she had spend almost as much time in America. Most
of her adult life was spend in America. Moreover it was not just the
soil that made you who you are but ideas played a huge role too.
She was distinctly American now. But India always made her happy.  All
her concerns vanished every time she went to India. India was a stress
absorber. Yes! She needed a base in India. </p>

<p> Thus began her search for a house in a seaside city near her
parent's village. There were many factors to consider. Since she was
not based in India she could not go for an independent house. Security
would be a problem. Property encroachment was a big worry. Hence, Arti
settled on buying an apartment. </p>

<p>Many years ago when Arti lived in Bangalore the prices of goods in
India were very low compared to America. But now it was exactly the
opposite. There was a new prime minister and India was progressing by
leaps and bounds. Poverty had greatly reduced across the
country. Overall there was an atmosphere of optimism. America on the
other hand was getting dragged in to some kind of abyss. Behind every
economic depression there are other break downs that are seldom
discussed. In an economic depression, scavengers who thrive on
carcasses take control. They drag the depression to all it is worth.
America was becoming unrecognizable for Arti. She waited like many
others for old America's return while years drifted away.
Arti's apartment hunt lasted for more than two years. Finally she
found a place she liked. The apartment was a dump but it was well
located. She could see the ocean from her apartment and that was a big
factor in her choice. Arti was trying to make life easy and the
builder she thought she was buying her house from was quite
reputed. The apartment cost her a fortune. In America if you made a
big purchase the sales people threw in many freebies. They wanted you
to come back or recommend your friends. But not so in India. </p>

<p> It was a half built house and it became Arti's responsibility to
finish it.  </p>

<p> "How can you sell a half finished house?" Arti asked the builder. "I
know nothing about building. I paid for a finished house." </p>

<p> "It is a second sale" said the builder. "But I will be kind enough
to help you. I will also pay you the money for the unfinished work." </p>

<p> "You pay me instead of I pay you?" asked Arti surprised. </p>

<p> "It is a second sale. It works like that" said the builder. </p>

<p>"What is a second sale?" asked Arti. </p>

<p>"You did not buy the house from me" said the builder. "You bought it
from another person." </p>

<p> This was true. Arti had bought it from a man who was selling the
unfinished house. This man had bought the house from the builder. At
that time Arti had assumed that the builder would finish the house for
her. </p>

<p>  "Will you complete the house?" Arti had asked the builder. </p>

<p>  "Do not worry" the builder had said. "You buy the house. Everything
will be alright." </p>

<p> After all the builder was quite reputed. Arti would not worry. At
first, Arti was quite happy that it was an incomplete house so that
she could add in her special touch. She had no idea that she had
bargained for being responsible for the wiring, the plumbing, the
windows, and all that came with a house building. The builder was
right that she need not worry. The house will be completed but it
would cost a lot of money. The builder would only compensate a small
part of the expenses. </p>

<p> "You paid that kind of money for a dump?" asked Kabir. </p>

<p> "This was supposed to be a luxury apartment" said Arti. </p>

<p> "Your idea of luxury is out of this world" said Kabir angrily. </p>

<p> Arti was at a loss of words. The only thing the builder seemed to care
about was the tiles. </p>

<p> "Did you choose your tiles?" the builder would ask.  </p>

<p> If Arti never cared about tiles, now she had no choice. She now had to
care about taps, sinks, doors, and of course tiles.  </p>

<p> "Yes, I did choose my tiles" Arti wanted to say. "And about
everything else!"  </p>

<p> But Arti did not want to argue. She wanted to get her house
completed. Wasting time only meant wasting money in this case.  Slowly, Arti
realized that the choice of tiles may not matter much but the choice
of many other things did. There were plenty of faucets and commodes to
choose from and one could easily be stuck with some monstrosity. </p>

<p> "Thank god I was there to choose wood for my bathroom doors" said Arti. </p>

<p> "The builder should have done that" said Kabir. </p>

<p>"The builder uses different wood" said Arti. "This is better." </p>
 
<p>"He should use the best wood" said Kabir. </p>

<p> "Commercial choice and personal choice can never be the same" said
Arti. "We will always choose the best for our house." </p>


<p> Everything had cost a lot of money. Kabir was losing his
patience. Their bank account was wiped out by an apartment in a tiny
little town in India. Arti felt rather foolish.  </p>

<p> Finally, when the house was completed, Arti forgot all the
expenses. The house was charming and had a nice energy. It felt like
an extension of herself. Moreover, she could see the sunsets over the
ocean every evening from her apartment. This was home.  She was at
peace here. Kabir was happy too because the apartment appreciated in
value considerably. </p>

<p> "Within a year the price of the house went up three times" said Arti.

<p> "If we had left the money in the bank, it would be paper" said Kabir.
"It is good to own a house instead. You did a good thing." </p>


<p> Arti also taught in India for the first time. The students were very
naughty. They would talk in class and did not seem that interested in
the course work. They were very different from the students she taught
in America. She was at a loss. But when the final exams were graded
her students had done quite well. They had their own approach to
studying. </p>

<p> "Teaching never disappoints" said Arti to herself as she flew back to
America. "The students always measure up." </p>

<p> The American recession had fundamentally changed Arti for the
better. She now was a good hands on engineer. In her spare time she
learned sculpture and ceramics. Also she was a very good mathematician
with a roof under the Indian sky. She knew for certain that America
was also transforming like her.  Arti waited eagerly to see what the
new day will bring. </p>
