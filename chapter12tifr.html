<h3> Chapter 12  </h3>
<h2>Coming to terms with India again  </h2>
        
<p> For Arti the initial excitement of settling down in India was soon
replaced by the anxiety of finding the right place to continue her
studies. She was working towards a PhD and had come back to India half
way with a Masters degree. The US degree sure helped to open doors to
prestigious institutes in India. Arti got an invitation to visit the
Mumbai research institute and she received a small stipend to cover
the stay. Since Kabir was in Bangalore it was not possible for Arti to
stay in Mumbai. The institute however had a branch in Bangalore but
she had to go to Mumbai to negotiate a deal. Thus Arti visited 
Mumbai and was staying  at the institute's Guest house. </p>

<p> Arti woke up to the sound of chirping sparrows which drowned all the
sounds of the morning. She thought of how distinct this morning sound
was of Mumbai. Yes, there were sparrows all over the world but in
Mumbai they were the loudest. Not many birds were seen in central
Mumbai.  But there were plenty of crows, sparrows, an occasional myna,
and a rare parrot. </p>

<p> It was time for breakfast and Arti looked forward to the Guest house
breakfast for it was always good. She went down to the dining room,
picked up a newspaper, and poured herself a cup of tea. She then went
and sat at an empty table and glanced around the room. People had not
arrived for breakfast yet. There was only an European professor with
his family at one table. He was telling his son about his trip to
Africa. He was introducing the cultures of the world to his son and
this Indian trip was part of that introduction. Arti briefly exchanged
a smile and went on to read her newspaper. </p>

<p> She had been out of touch with Indian politics for six years and now
it had become interesting to her again. The fundamentalist party was
gaining power, the ruling party lacked charismatic leaders, and
there was an air of suspense. Will India become a fundamentalist
country like all her neighbors? Or will India remain secular? Arti
hoped with all her heart that India remained secular. </p>

<p> Soon she was served the eggs and toasts she had asked for. The tea was
great and she poured herself another cup. </p>

<p> "May I join you?" asked a French Lady coming up to Arti's table. </p>

<p> "Sure, I am Arti and you are?"  asked Arti. </p>

<p> "I am Jane. Are you a student here?" asked  Jane. </p>

<p> "I am visiting. I just came back from America and need to find out
where I will be studying. Have you been in India long?" asked Arti. </p>

<p> "This is my second trip down here. The last time I went to Delhi" Jane
said. </p>

<p> "What are you doing here?" asked Arti. </p>

<p> "I am studying tropical diseases" said Jane.</p>

<p> Jane was soon served Poha (rice flakes) and she said </p>

<p> "I love vegetarian Indian cooking. In India I always eat vegetarian." </p>

<p> "Are you playing safe by not eating meat?" asked Arti. </p>

<p> "Well, no. Oh, no, no, no. Don't misunderstand. I truly like
vegetarian food" said Jane. </p>

<p> Jane was defensive with good reason. When western tourists gave advice
about India they usually advised to eat vegetarian. They did not trust
the meat in India. Jane got a sense that Arti knew this fact. Arti
laughed and decided to let sleeping dogs rest. </p>

<p> "How has your visit been so far?" asked Arti. </p>

<p> "Good. This institute is great. No beggars to bother you. People leave
you alone. I am getting a few things done" said Jane. </p>

<p> "Well, beggars are a problem not just to tourists. They exist and they
will not disappear just because they are a nuisance. If they have to go
somethings must change for better" said Arti a little irritated. </p>

<p> "I know" said Jane. </p>

<p> "So what disease are you studying currently?" asked Arti not wanting
to discuss India any further.  She herself was in a tourist mode of
discovery and it was confusing to talk about things she was looking
with a fresh perspective herself. A couple of days ago she had seen a
little girl follow a foreigner asking for money. The foreigner was
obviously annoyed and yet the girl followed making the most pathetic
pleas. Arti wanted to stop the girl and she wanted to say </p>

<p> "Little girl, you must not beg from foreigners. It makes us look bad
as a nation. It almost looks like our country is begging when you beg.
That is bad for our pride." </p>

 <p> Arti had laughed at that thought. Pride did not fill an hungry
stomach. What did national pride mean to a three year old girl?
Moreover pride was not a quality that would be useful for her in her
begging. The least pride she had the better chance she had at
survival. Pride was an indulgence of the rich. </p>

<p> Jane did not care much about judging India either though she was
invariably called upon to do so. She was there purely for academic
reasons. Jane went on to describe her research on Malaria and how she
believed a certain drug that worked for a certain kind of fever would
work for Malaria as well. </p>

<p> After breakfast Arti went to the library. It was a matter of pride for
the institute that the library was computerized. Finding a book was
supposed to have become a lot easier. This would have been true for
every one if the computer worked properly. But when Arti tried to
search for a book the computer was no help. So Arti went and asked for
help at the help desk and the librarian said </p>

<p> "There is a bug in the program. I will show you a work around." </p>

<p> The librarian then taught Arti how to input data so as to outwit the
computer bug. The library was well equipped and Arti browsed through
the latest journals and was quite happy with the collection of books
and journals.  This library was world class and she would have no
problems finding any books she needed.  </p>

<p> "Do you want to go and get some tea?" asked Chitra when she saw Arti.  </p>

<p> "Yes. Tea will be nice" said Arti.  </p>

<p> That was part of the research culture of India. People talked over
cups of tea at the canteen. Arti found herself drinking too many cups
of tea each day.  </p>

<p> "It is funny how people in India live with workarounds" said Arti. "We
do not try to fix a bug if we have a workaround. We are very tolerant
of imperfections even if we could change it quite easily. I wonder why
we are like that."   </p>

<p> "It must be our food" shrugged Chitra.  </p>


<p> Being back in India meant not only meeting a lot of old relatives but
 a lot of old friends too. That afternoon, Arti was to meet Pooja at
 her work place, and then go together to some restaurant for
 lunch. Pooja's office was located in a posh building in central
 Mumbai. Arti was impressed by the architecture of the building she
 was entering. The security personnel were very well dressed.  Arti
 took the elevator to the floor Pooja worked in.  </p>

<p> "Can I meet Pooja?" asked Arti to the receptionist. </p>

<p> "Please wait, Madam. I will call her and see whether she can meet you
now" said the receptionist. </p>

<p> After a few minutes Pooja was out at the reception room and said </p>

<p> "Hi Arti. Sharda is coming with us for lunch too. She is excited
about seeing you after such a long time." </p>

<p> "This is a posh office. I never knew you worked in such a hep place"
said Arti. </p>

<p> "We do alright" said Pooja smiling. </p>

<p> "I would be kind of afraid to raise my voice here" said Arti. </p>

<p> "It is not that bad" said Pooja laughing. "Come along. Sharada is
waiting in the lobby downstairs."  </p>

<p> Sharada indeed was waiting for them and they exchanged a quick hello.
Arti was at a loss of words. Here was Sharada and she had known her
as a good friend in her undergraduate days. They had exchanged a few
letters and soon they had lost contact. Arti tried to measure how
much Sharada might have changed. Arti tried to be herself and say
a warm hello and say she was thrilled about seeing Sharada after such
a long time and yet words failed her. </p>

<p> "Sharada, you are like a new person to me. I have to pick up a lot of
threads that are lost in these many years" said Arti. </p>

<p> Fortunately their immediate concern was finding a restaurant. </p>

<p> "Do you like Marwari food?" asked Pooja. </p>

<p> "I don't know what Marwari food is" said Arti. </p>

<p> "It is like Gujarati food. It is all vegetarian. The thali in Baghat's
restaurant is quite good" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "It sounds good to me" said Arti. </p>

<p> The three women were what people called foreign returned. Pooja had
just come back from living in Japan and Sharada from America.  When
they reached the restaurant the waiters showed them to their seats.
They had chosen to be seated in the air conditioned section. Everyone
called them madam. </p>

<p>"It is strange when they call you madam. Do we look that grown up now?"
asked Arti. </p> 

<p> "It feels strange to me too, I cannot get used to it" said Sharada. </p>

<p> "It is so different now when we get together at a restaurant" said
Arti. "During our college days we had limited money and we would
debate whether all of us could afford the AC room or not. We would
budget whether our money could get us a ticket to a cinema and get us
a meal. Those were the days." </p>

<p> Soon they had ordered lemonades for all and they decided to stick to
the college meal for old times sakes while they tried to put their
lives together. </p>

<p> "Tell me about you Sharada" said Arti. "I know a little about Pooja
since I have kept in touch with her by email. Tell me what are your
dreams and goals now." </p>

<p> "Not much dreaming these days" said Sharada. "I have a son and my time
is completely taken up by my work and my son. I try to take up easy
projects so that I have more time for my home." </p>

<p> "Why?" asked Arti.  "You were not like that. You were one of the best
students in our college. Don't you get bored if your work is not
challenging?" </p>

<p> "I cannot do much about it so I do not think much about it. But my son
is fun and I feel guilty staying away from him for too long" said
Sharada. </p>

<p>  "I think this guilt is part of being a woman" said Arti. "Our
priorities are supposed to be the family. If the son was not there,
you still would be as guilty for ignoring the husband. But give up all
dreams and to settle down for a mediocre life is not acceptable to
me. It never was and it will never be. Or just to bask in a husband's
trophies is also not enough. I need my own identity. I do not like being
called Mrs so and so or someone's mother all the time. I want to be
known for myself. This will is strong."  </p>

<p>  "You have not changed at all Arti. It is good to know that" said Sharada. </p>

<p>  "She has not changed at all. That is true" said Pooja. </p>

<p>  "I have changed quite a bit. It just seems to you that I haven't" said
Arti laughing. </p>

<p>  The food had arrived and the women picked at the food. The old enthusiasm
of college days for Chole Batura or Pao Bhaji was missing.  </p>

<p> "What about you Pooja, do you feel this need to establish an
identity strongly?" asked Arti. </p>

<p>  "Not really" said Pooja. "I do not mind being called Mrs so and so all
the time.  I like being financially independent or let us say I like
having enough money. I could give up this job without a second
thought." </p>

<p>  "Then is it just me? Marriage is one of the oldest professions for a
woman and a demanding one at that. Yet I need more challenges for my
mind. My dreams do not end in a household" said Arti. </p>
 
<p> "Good to see all that enthusiasm. It is really good that you have
not changed" said Sharada again. </p>

<p> It was quite clear that Sharada did not have any inclination to change
her lifestyle.  Arti's life for her would be like a book she would
read if she had time in a tedious journey. </p>

<p> The women did not eat much. The tip they left was heavy. These were
successful women of society. Well read, well traveled, and with
successful husbands. The lunch hour was over. Pooja and Sharada had to
get back to work and Arti to exploring the Mumbai she had returned to
after six years. </p>

<p> "It is good to know you have not changed" said Sharada again as they
left. </p>

<p> Arti walked back slowly to the bus stop that would take her back to
the campus.  She paused on the way to do some window shopping and just
to take in the scenery. Mumbai seemed more crowded than before, the
huts on the pavements had increased, and yet it also appeared
richer than before. </p>

<p> Arti had to keep pulling up the salwar which she was wearing since it
was too long and she had only bought it recently but she liked the
feeling of the dupatta around her neck. It made her feel very
feminine. Even the regular salwar kameez which was every day wear for
Indian women was now new to her. Her wardrobe had been different in
the US.  She sensed that there was something odd in her behavior for
some people were watching her. She herself felt like she was in a new
world. The sun and the sweat were also now new to her. She felt like she
was walking in a hothouse and the warm moist tropical air was pleasing
to her. She felt thirsty as she watched the coconut sellers on the
street and she wished she had company so she could stop and get a
drink. The next minute she said to herself "Hey! I am foreign
returned. The least I can do is drink coconut water from a vendor on
my own." </p>

<p> Arti bought herself a coconut and sipped the water with a straw. Then
the seller chipped a little spoon from the shell of the coconut for her
and scraped the thin layer of cream inside the coconut for her to eat.
Arti was happy about the coconut water and she paid the coconut seller
with a beaming smile which surprised him a little and so she explained
"There are no coconut sellers in America. This is great." </p>

<p> "So Memsaab do not like America?" he asked. </p>

<p> "No, no. I also like India that is all" she said. </p>

<p> Arti walked a little longer buying herself a few more trivialities and
then she took the bus back to her room. She was happy. She saw the
books she was supposed to be reading on the table, some of them open
and inviting.  But she chose to go to the Balcony instead.  She sat on
the chair and watched the sunset. She could see and hear the
ocean. She could not ask for more. This was home. </p>
