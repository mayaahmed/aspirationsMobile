<h3> Chapter 14  </h3>
<h2>The Farm </h2>

<p> Arti's parents did not live in Mumbai anymore. It was typical for many
elder people to move out from Mumbai and retire in smaller towns or
villages. Arti's parents moved to a village in the south of India.
Arti had not seen the place yet and she was really thrilled when she
finally got time to visit them. </p>

<p> "I am glad we are going to my father's farmhouse. I wonder what it is
like" said Arti. </p>

<p> Arti and Kabir traveled by bus to the farmhouse.  It was an eight hour
journey and people preferred to travel at night.  That way they planned
to sleep through the journey. </p>

<p> The bus was a pretty fancy bus compared to the local buses.  Arti
heard a woman complaint that the bus did not have a video player. But
it did have a cassette player and all through the night they played
songs real loud. Once in a while there was silence and someone in the
bus would scold the driver for not starting the music soon. </p>

<p> "What a way to travel! These people do like to suffer and make others
suffer with their ridiculous music" complained Kabir. </p>

<p> Arti was glad when it was morning. </p>

<p> "At least there is some good scenery outside. If you cannot sleep
at least you can enjoy the view" said Arti. </p>

<p>The bus had traveled quite far from Bangalore and in that morning
light Arti felt she was in paradise. The red mud, the
tall tropical trees, and the sounds of the birds along the long
winding roads was a heady mix. </p>

<p> "I wonder what my father's house is like" said Arti. "I hope it is like my
grandfather's house in Kerala. My grandfather's house was at the
foothills of a hill.  The backyard opened into a large black rock. The
house was surrounded by rows and rows of trees. I hope my father's
house is like that."  </p>

<p> "You will be seeing it soon. So you can stop wondering" said Kabir. </p>

<p> "The black rock where I sat many a lazy summer afternoons thinking
and wondering about my future. Big black rocks can make you
philosophical" said Arti musing. </p>

<p> She could see herself as a little girl roaming on the rock. </p>

<p> "The rows and rows of rubber trees and a road far away. I always
had a feeling that someone special would come from that road. It was
like that road so far away would bring adventure. I wonder what my
father's house is like."  </p>

<p> Arti's father was at the bus stop to pick her up. </p>

<p> "Papa, I wonder what our house is like. Is it like that house there?"
asked Arti pointing to a house. </p>

<p> "No. It is better" her father said.  </p>

<p> All along the way Arti pointed to houses asking her father whether
their house was like that and her father kept saying that their house
was better.  </p>

<p> Finally they reached their farmhouse. At first Arti was disappointed.
Not because the house was not good, but it was different from what
she thought it would be. There was no black rock and for some reason
she was so sure there would be a black rock behind her house.  </p>

<p> "Where is the stream?" asked Arti.   </p>

<p> Arti could not think of a farm house without a stream. Her mother had
told her that their farmhouse did have a stream.  </p>

<p> "I will show you" said her mother and she took her behind the house
and showed her the stream. It was a little stream and there were small
fish in it.  </p>

<p> "Oh! I wanted a big stream" said Arti.  </p>

<p> "This is all that we have" said Arti's mother a little upset that
Arti was not thrilled with the little stream.  </p>

<p>"Sorry, Ma. I am adjusting my mental image to reality. It is quite a
nice place" said Arti.  </p>

<p> Soon her father's farm house defined itself in Arti's mind.  It was
different from her grandfather's house. It was unique and interesting
in its own way. The neighbors stopped by for the whole village knew
that Arti was visiting.  </p>

<p> "Arti, come and say hello to this chedati (aunt)" her mother
called out. </p>

<p> When Arti went to the front porch, there was a little crowd of old
women gathered there to meet her. These were her mother's
friends. Arti greeted them. The women were staring at Arti and one
woman asked her mother where the son in law was. Arti's mother pointed
him out to them. Kabir waved to them from where he was and the ladies
giggled. Arti was at a loss of words.  She stared at them and they at
her. </p>

<p> "Can you speak Malayalam?" one lady asked. </p>

<p> "Of course I can speak Malayalam" said Arti. "Where do you live?" </p>
 
<p> Arti congratulated herself for having found this question. The
question was politically correct, respectful and also proved that she
could talk Malayalam. There was no way Arti could get into trouble
asking people where they lived. Her mother seemed to approve of that
question and looked on beaming with pride. Arti asked every new person
she met over the next few days the same question. </p>

<p> "Conversation skills require some standard questions" declared
Arti. </p>

<p> Soon Arti had settled herself in the farmhouse. </p>

<p> "Walking on your land, the land you own is a great feeling" said
Arti.  "In Mumbai, our flats are so small. Here even the poorest of
the poor have a little land of their own. Mumbai steals something
fundamental from all of us by being so crowded." </p>


<p>  The little farm was full of surprises. The rows and rows of banana,
 coconut, and cashew trees belonged to her father.  Kabir spend all
 the time breaking coconuts from the trees and drinking the water.
 Arti's mother owned many chickens.  She showed Arti the collection of
 eggs she would gather each morning into a little basket. Arti would
 steal eggs and give it to the farm dog. The farm dog would hold the
 egg very carefully and punch a nail into the egg shell and lick the
 inside of the egg slowly. </p>

<p>  "Don't waste all my good eggs" her mother would scold. </p>

<p> "What is life but a few interesting moments. If we look back in time,
life is not thirty years but some thirty events. The days I spend in
the farm are among those events" said Arti on her way back to
Bangalore. </p>
