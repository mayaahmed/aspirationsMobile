<h3> Chapter 18  </h3>
<h2> About being a Mathematician </h2>


<p> Arti met Rajini at a grocery store. As soon as Rajini heard Arti was a
mathematician Rajini wanted Arti to inspire her children to do math. </p>

<p> "Arti, since you are working on a PhD in mathematics, perhaps you can
motivate my children to do mathematics" said Rajini. </p>

<p> "I am not good at inspiring little children to study math" said Arti. </p>

<p> "I want them to meet you" said Rajini enthusiastically. "I want you
to talk to them." </p>

<p> "I will try to tell them math is fun" said Arti with a shrug. </p>

<p> A lunch was planned and Arti set out to motivate Rajini's children to
study mathematics.  One look at the children and Arti gave up on her
plans. It was ridiculous to tell children hardly five years of age to
study mathematics. Arti instead spend time playing with them. </p>

<p> Later Arti told Rajini </p>

<p> "Children learn by imitating their parents or their peers. You cannot
lecture them in to getting interested in anything. A one year child is
very interested in the pots and pans he sees his mother use more than
any other toy you might give him to play with. The best way to teach
children math is by finding a reason to do math yourself." </p>

<p> "At this age, you surely do not expect me to study mathematics" said
Rajini laughing. </p>

<p> "Then you cannot expect them to study mathematics at their age either" said
Arti conclusively. </p>

<p> "But they have to" said Rajini. "Times have changed. The world is a
lot more competitive now." </p>

<p> Why every child should find math fun because the world became
competitive was not clear. There would always be jobs that did not
require much math skills. A lot of well paying jobs and careers did
not require math skills at all. But Arti did not want to agitate
Rajini. Rajini knew what was best for her children. It was clear that
most parents wanted their children to excel in mathematics. </p>

<p> "I will come back in a few years to inspire your children" said Arti
as she took her leave. "I find them too young right now." </p>

<p> Arti had planned to study all her life. The idea that one had to be in
a certain age group to study would not work in academics. Though being a
mathematician was not as grand as being a film star, it did generate a 
certain kind of awe among people. </p>

<p> "You must be smart!" people would say to Arti time and again.   </p>

<p> Arti did not particularly think of herself as smart. The only reason
she became a mathematician was because mathematics was the easiest
thing for her to do. Only a few people spend lot of time learning
classical music. But the ones who did were not called smart. But
people in general thought mathematicians were smart.   </p>

<p> But there were a few who were not mathematicians but thought they knew
more mathematics than mathematicians. Such people called upon Arti to
solve all kinds of tricky problems. If she did not know the answer to
some question the person asking questions would conclude that he was
better than her at math. The problem was that like art almost every
one was exposed to some level of mathematics. But mathematics was hard
work. After hours of working on a problem, Arti would get physically
tired. It was difficult to explain because brain work is not
considered physically tiring.  Moreover no one could question Arti's
passion for mathematics. She would ignore every other activity to
spend her time with books. Hard work and passion were the keys to
becoming a professional at any skill. To be considered a mathematician
it was not enough to have a few tricky questions up your sleeve. It
was necessary to spend years doing mathematics.  </p>
