<h3> Chapter 19  </h3>
<h2> Difficult times </h2>

<p> Soon there would be personal trouble. Arti's father had to go for a
minor surgery but it resulted in temporary memory loss, incontinence,
and difficulty in movement. He was diagnosed with Normal Pressure
Hydrocephalus which meant that the brain held on to excess water. The
doctors recommended brain surgery. Arti's family was hesitant about
another surgery because one surgery had lead to this condition for her
father. Arti rushed back home to see her father. It was heart
wrenching to see her father so changed. He could hardly speak or
remember what he did a few minutes before. He could not walk and most
of the time he spend sitting on a chair or lying in bed. </p>

<p> Arti decided that before they go in for surgery they would try
everything else possible. They got Ayurvedic doctors to massage Arti's
father and he showed remarkable improvement. So Arti came back to the
US thinking that in time her father would recover. But his condition
got worse. </p>

<p> Something had gone wrong in Arti's professional life too. Arti found
herself without a job after a PhD in mathematics. She tried to make
sense of the situation. </p>

<p> "These are difficult times" said one professor. "Jobs are difficult
to come by." </p>

<p> This argument did not make sense. A lot of people who were graduating
with her had job offers and more than one for that matter. She had
been a consistently better student than all of them. It did not make
sense that her department thought it was normal for her to not find
employment. </p>

<p> "It is alright" said a colleague. "That blond guy with blue eyes did
not get a job either." </p>

<p> "Sorry. I cannot feel better that I do not have a job just because a
blond guy with blue eyes did not find one" said Arti irritated. </p>

<p> "The scientific committee decided that Americans should find jobs
before immigrants" said another colleague. </p>

<p> "How do you know?" asked Arti. "None of the job advertisements say
that.  It is preposterous to assume that most mathematicians anywhere
in the world can do the kind of work I do." </p>

<p> "We love immigrants" he continued. "This country was build by
immigrants.  But we must take care of Americans who were here first." </p>
 
<p>  "Whatever!" said Arti. </p>

<p> Arti was facing a lot of new arguments. Arti had never faced
discrimination in her life in America before. The teachers were always
more than fair.  In an American classroom it never had mattered who
she was or where she came from. It only mattered that she was
interested and ready to work hard. This attitude was new to her. An
ominous change was sweeping across America and this was only the
beginning. </p>

<p> But what made  Arti really angry is when she heard people close to her say </p>

<p> "There are some dreams that do not come true." </p>

<p> "No one would work hard towards a dream if they had this attitude"
Arti would reply angrily every time to that statement. </p>


<p> Arti was in no mood to reassure people that it was fine to be
unemployed.  This habit of people annoyed her.  People visit hospitals
and are greatly reassured when the sick man tells them he is fine. He
is not fine till he recovers. There was nothing fine about being
unemployed either. In time, if things got better she would stand out
as an example of how in spite of things going horribly wrong she
survived. It annoyed her that she was to be that kind of example. </p>

<p> Arti was happy she was married and she had a home to come back to when
things had gone wrong. She worried about other scientists who did not
have this choice. </p>

<p> "It is not enough if an individual strives to succeed" said
Kavita. "We came so far because the entire system was geared to bring
us here. All efforts of an individual are wasted in a faulty system." </p>

<p> "A pitcher full of holes cannot retain water" said Kabir. </p>

<p> There was a silver lining in these dark clouds and that was that Arti
had free time. Her father was ill and she could attend to him. Her
siblings had jobs and were very busy. Thus Arti traveled to India to
take care of her father. His disease had progressed and his condition
had worsened. Brain surgery seemed to be the last resort.  Any doubts
that Arti had about heading for surgery subsided when she met the
surgeon. He looked like he knew his job. </p>

<p> The night before the surgery Arti's relatives came from far and wide.
The hospital room was filled with visitors. Late in to the night
people recalled stories from their memory. They laughed about events
in the past. Arti was afraid that laughing too much might bring bad
luck. She was really frightened about her father's surgery. But it was
good to have family around. They reduced stress considerably. All
through the hospital stay visitors took the focus away from the sick
environment of the hospital room. India truly was a cradle of
affection. </p>

<p> After the surgery Arti's father was physically very weak. He seemed to
be slightly more mentally aware. There was no visible progress in his
condition. It was depressing and Arti resigned herself to never having
a real conversation with her father again. Arti left India with a
heavy heart. Her father was a mess and may never recover again. </p>
