<h3> Chapter 4  </h3>
<h2>At the Fun Fair  </h2>

<p> Kavita and Pooja went shopping because there was a sale in one of
their favorite shops. </p>

<p> "This is a rather pretty dress. And it costs only two hundred rupees.
I am going to buy this" said Kavita picking up a leaf green dress with
mirror embroidery. </p>

<p> "That is really a nice dress, Kavita" agreed Pooja. "You are lucky you
found it. It is difficult to find good things in a sale.  That dress
is nice." </p>

<p> Kavita then heard a soft voice say in Malayalam from behind. </p> 

<p> "Mandi ende uduppu idutu (The dumbo took my dress)."  </p> 

<p> Kavita turned around and saw two girls standing behind her. One of the
girls looked really disappointed that Kavita had picked up the green
dress. It was evident that this girl had liked the dress. Instead of
buying the dress up front the girl had gone looking for her friend for
a second opinion. </p>

<p> "Areya mandi vilikyanado? (Who are you calling dumb?)" asked Kavita
in Malayalam menacingly. </p>

<p> "Are you a Malayali?" asked the girl who called Kavita mandi. She was
really surprised at this turn of events. </p>

<p> "Yes. Be careful about calling people names" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "I am sorry. I did not mean you. I was talking about someone else.
I would never call a Malayali names" said the girl apologetically. </p>

<p> "You should not call anyone names" said Kavita laughing. </p>

<p> "I did not know you were a Malayali. You did not look like a Malayali.
I am really sorry" said the girl. </p>

<p> "That is  because I am a Mallu from Mumbai" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "Where are you from?" asked the girl. </p>

<p> "What do you mean? I just said I am from Mumbai" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "Yes, yes. That we know. But where are you from in Kerala?" asked the
girl. </p>

<p> "From Ernakulum. I mean my parents are from Ernakulum" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "Ernakulum! I am also from Ernakulum" said the girl. </p>

<p> "I bet you are really sorry now that you called me mandi" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "Oh no! I did not call you mandi. I was talking about someone else"
said the girl. </p> 

<p> Kavita said goodbye to the two girls. Pooja also found a dress she
liked. They went to the cash counter to pay for the dress. </p>

<p> "That girl did not care about me or my name. All that she cared for
was where my parental home is in Kerala!" exclaimed Kavita. </p>

<p> "People are strange. But you sure surprised her by talking to her in
Malayalam. The poor thing" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "I should have asked her who is the mandi now" said Kavita laughing. </p>

<p> "Yes" said Pooja and she went on to say something. But Kavita did not
listen.  Her attention was grabbed completely by the handsome stranger
she had met in the train. He was sitting at a table in a juice shop
across the road.  He was accompanied by a female and he seemed
engrossed in some conversation.  Who was that female? The question
raced in her mind. Somehow the scene pained Kavita. Why did this
stranger affect her so? This was a kind of pain she had never known
before. Her pride, her anger, or her brain would be no match and she
felt she would melt down in tears any moment. </p>

<p> "That is the stranger I met in the train" Kavita told Pooja. </p>

<p> "He has nice hair" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "Yes, that is his crowning glory" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "Forget him. He has a girlfriend" said Pooja. </p>

<p>"Maybe she is his sister" said Kavita. She did not like the idea of having
to forget the stranger.  </p>

<p> "Don't be silly. It sure looks like his girlfriend" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "That is too bad. Now I will have to work towards forgetting him" said
Kavita very disappointed. </p>

<p> "Serves you right to go about liking people without knowing anything about
them" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "Maybe she is just a casual friend" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "Don't be silly. Let us go" said Pooja laughing. </p>

<p> "The brute. He behaves like he has forgotten that I exist. I will teach him
a lesson by forgetting him" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "If he has forgotten that you exist then how will your forgetting him
matter to him?" asked Pooja. </p>

<p> "Good point. Let us remind him of my existence" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "Now how will you go about doing that?" asked Pooja. </p>

<p> "I don't know. Throw a rock at him or something?" asked Kavita. </p>

<p> "Nice way to behave that would be!" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "A rock thrown at him will do him more good than harm" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "You will soon forget him, Kavita. Don't worry" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "Well, I could forget him. But I don't like to forget him" said Kavita
quietly. </p>

<p> "Sometimes you have to do things you do not like" said Pooja firmly. </p>

<p> "Okay. But love sure brings more pain than joy" said Kavita and they
headed towards home. </p>

<p> "Are you in love?" asked Pooja. </p>

<p> "I don't know. All I know is that I am terribly upset at this moment"
said Kavita. </p>

<p> "One can never fathom why people ever fall in love. Kavita, just
keep out of all that for another year. Our exams are very near and you need
to spend all your energies towards it" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "You are right. The all important board exams" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "The board exams decide your future. It will decide what your life will
be tomorrow. It will decide what you will become" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "In other words the board exam will define me. No exam is that important
Pooja. You are going overboard with the board exam" said Kavita laughing. </p>

<p> "But you get the picture,  Don't you?" asked Pooja. </p>

<p> "Only too well. But I bet that woman is of no consequence. Anyways What does
it matter? I might never see him again" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "Silly girl" said Pooja shaking her head.  </p>

<p> Though Kavita did not say it aloud she also thought it was a good idea
to forget the stranger. And she decided to do just that. A few days
later Kavita decided to arrange the papers in her father's
wallet. Kavita liked to take care of her father's belongings. She
would iron his clothes, polish his boots, and arrange his papers.  He
never asked her to do anything but when she did something for him, he
would make a big fuss about what a wonderful job she had done. Kavita
liked this game very much. </p>

<p> It was an old wallet, soft to touch, and it was beginning to tear at
the rims. Kavita straightened up the folded rupee notes and removed
all the junk paper like bus tickets and scrap notes from the
wallet. Her eyes fell on a visiting card which had the name Amar
written on it. A telephone number was also written below the name. </p>

<p> "Amar is his name" said Kavita to herself. She now knew his name and
his telephone number. The card was the visiting card of a travel
agency and surely did not belong to Amar. She now knew a little more
about the stranger than before but it did not make her happy. The
scene in the Juice shop of Amar chatting up a woman kept coming back
to her thoughts and somehow Amar did not belong to her solely
anymore. Only a few days back she thought she owned him for no
particular reason. She thought she owned him for she owned him in her
thoughts. And that logic brought a smile to her lips. She almost threw
the card in a waste paper basket when something in her stopped her
from doing so. The visiting card landed among Kavita's papers on her
desk. </p>

<p> Her desk was completely cluttered with all sorts of books. In four
months time she would face one of the toughest exams of her career,
the board exams. Her life was completely in jitters and she had
started the habit of studying late into the night. </p>

<p> "Do you need some coffee, Mole?" Kavita's father asked. He had woken
up from deep sleep to come and ask her whether she wanted coffee. </p>

<p> "No, Papa. If I need some I will get it myself" said Kavita. The
entire family usually felt the stress if someone was appearing
for a board exam. </p>

<p> "You are tired. I will get you some coffee" said Kavita's father and
appeared again soon with a cup of coffee. </p>

<p> "You never enter the kitchen usually. Now your daughter is studying
and so you are making coffee" teased  Kavita's mother. </p>

<p> "Poor child is working so hard" said Kavita's father. </p>

<p> Kavita was a little embarrassed that her parents thought she worked
hard.  Some of her friends had finished studying the syllabus three
times by this time and she was still half way through the
syllabus. All that faith made her concerned and she concentrated more
on her books. </p>

<p> Sure enough most of her time was soon occupied by thoughts of her
exams. Also she was constantly thinking about the fact that this was going
to be the last year of school for her. She had gone to this school building
for ten years almost everyday. The fact that she would go no more to
the school building was unpleasant to her. </p>

<p> "One of the last times I take this bus to school" Kavita thought when she
entered the local bus that took her to school. </p>

<p> To Kavita's pleasant surprise she saw Amar sitting in front of her in
the bus. She had recently felt like throwing a rock at him but she
thought that she should talk to him. After all he had been invading
prime time in her thoughts. </p>

<p> "Hi" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "Hi" said Amar. </p>

<p> It went well. But what to say next? </p>

<p> "Hello" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "Hello" said Amar. He responded like a puppy with rapt attention
every time she spoke to him. She almost felt like saying "Nice, nice
puppy. Nice, nice hair."  But that was not how people talked to each
other especially if they were perfect strangers. </p>

<p> "Nice day, isn't it?" asked Kavita instead. </p>

<p> "Yes, thapat puppat thuppat ..." Amar continued to talk about something. </p>

<p> "Please talk in English. I do not understand Italian" said Kavita at a
loss about what Amar was saying. </p>

<p> "I am talking in English. tup tiup kiup..." Amar continued.
Amar had the smug expression of a person who had said all the things
he wanted to say very well. </p>

<p> "Are you talking in some code language?" asked Kavita. </p>

<p> "No" and he continued with more talk that could not be understood. </p>

<p> But soon Kavita had to leave for the bus had reached the school bus
stop. She said goodbye reluctantly. Amar had not made any
sense with his talk and yet it was pleasant when he had been
near. Somehow his company was relaxing and for a short time she had
forgotten her troubles. As she stepped out of the bus Amar had piqued
her interest all the more by his unintelligible ramblings. </p>

<p> When classes began for the day Kavita's class teacher announced  </p>

<p> "We are going to have a Fun Fair this year." </p>

<p> "What is a Fun Fair?" asked Pooja. </p>

<p> "We will have exhibitions of different kinds. We will have a science
exhibition, art and crafts exhibition, food exhibition, and many other
kinds of exhibitions. It will be truly fun and so it is called a Fun
Fair" explained the teacher. </p>

<p> "Are we part of the organizing?" asked Kavita. </p>

<p> "Oh no! You are all facing the board exams. I will absolutely not
permit any distractions. You all must concentrate on the exams.
All your time should be spend preparing for the exams" said the class
teacher. </p>

<p> "It looks like we play no part in the Fun Fair. Then why did you tell
us about it?" asked Kavita a little disappointed. </p>

<p> "You must participate by attending. There are no classes that
week. You must come and take part in the games, eat the good food, and
see the exhibitions" said the teacher. </p>

<p> "Well, okay" said Pooja with a shrug. </p>

<p>  As the week of the Fun Fair approached, Kavita and her friends saw a
lot of activity around the school building. Many parents got
involved in teaching students crafts that were not part of the school
curriculum. Kavita and her friends would stop by to watch briefly. </p>

<p> "This doll is really pretty" said Kavita holding up a doll. The dress
of the doll was made of pretty pink sponge and was soft to touch. But
the dress was held together with hundreds of pin covered with gold
and stone beads. </p>

<p> "I am scared these pins will hurt a kid while playing with this doll"
Kavita expressed her concern. </p>

<p> "That doll is not for children to play with. One would not spend so
much time and energy making toys for children. These dolls are for the
showcase" said Manju's mother a little annoyed. </p>

<p> "Why can't you make toys that children can play with?" asked Kavita. </p>

<p> "If you want to make such toys, you can make it yourself" said Manju's
mother now getting really angry. </p>

<p> "Either her diabetes or blood pressure must be acting up. It is not a
safe place to be with all those pins around" advised Pooja. </p>

<p> Kavita made a quick retreat and went to the next room which had a
label that said "FOOD COURT" in bold letters outside the door. The mothers
in that room looked a lot happier. </p>

<p> "Hello, Kavita. Looking forward to the Fun Fair?" asked Mandira's mother. </p>

<p> "Yes. What are you going to sell?" asked Kavita. </p>

<p> "All kinds of things. We will have samosas, pani puris, bhel puris,
masala dosas, and idlis. We have a lot of things for you. Do stop by here
during the Fun Fair" said Mandira's mother. </p>

<p> "We surely will" said Kavita.  </p>

<p> When they were out of earshot distance from Mandira's mother Pooja said  </p>

<p> "I bet the bhel puri will be gross. Homemade bhel puris are surely not
my thing." </p>

<p> "Not mine either. Bhel puris can only be made right by the street sellers
of Mumbai. These mothers should stick to making chapatis or something"
said Kavita. </p>

<p> "I bet there will be a few morons who will venture here" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "God save them" said Kavita and her friends laughed. </p>

<p> Their class teacher was busy in the science lab but when she saw the
girls she said </p>

<p> "Kavita, Pooja, Radha. I have some work for you."  </p>

<p> "For the Fun Fair?" asked Radha a little surprised. </p>

 <p> "Yes. I want you to be in charge of some exhibitions" said the
teacher. "Kavita, would you like to volunteer to man the science
exhibition booths?"   </p>

<p> "My board exams! What about that?" asked Kavita. </p>

<p> "This will help you prepare for the exams. I am making you in charge
of the brain section. You will have to tell people about the cerebrum
and the cerebellum.  You learned this in biology.  Prepare well. I
trust you to do a good job" said the teacher. She assigned explaining
polythene to Pooja and Radha got to demonstrate volcanoes. </p>

<p> Soon it was the week of the Fun Fair. They did not have to wear
uniforms. Kavita planned the clothes she would wear for the week. She
could not help thinking it was a lot easier wearing uniforms.
Kavita's table had a lot of charts and models of the brain
and the nerve centers. There were a few bottles which held preserved
brain in some fluid that smelt like vinegar. </p>

<p> "That is a monkey's brain. This is a rat's brain, this is a sheep's
brain, and this is a man's brain" said Kavita pointing out the brains
to a curious little girl. </p>

<p> "How do you know this is a man's brain?" asked the little girl. Kavita
toyed with the idea of what answer she should give. She could tell her
that the labels were what told Kavita which brain was whose but that
would probably dampen the girl's enthusiasm. </p>

<p> So Kavita said "One could test the brain cells under a microscope and
then one can tell whether it is a monkey's brain or a man's brain." </p>

<p> "Really? How cool!" said the girl. </p>

<p> After a few minutes Kavita saw the little girl asking a lot of
questions to Parvati who was in charge of the section of viewing cells
with microscopes. Kavita laughed to herself quietly as she heard the
words microscope and monkey brains uttered by the little girl. </p>

<p> The class teacher came to hand out some coupons and said
"You are doing a great job. You should take a break. Here are some
coupons. You can buy food or play  games with it." </p>

<p> "Thanks" said Kavita and went and looked for Pooja. </p>

<p> "Ready to take a break?" asked Kavita. </p>

<p> "Yes. I was going to look for you too" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "We have coupons to spend. Let us explore" said Kavita. </p>

<p> They went to a couple of floors below and they saw the food court
again. No way were they planning to stop there but as luck would have
it Mandira's mother saw them. </p>

<p> "Come here. Try some bhel puri. It is very good. It will get over soon.
Come here, come here" said Mandira's mother. </p>

<p> There was no escape so Kavita said </p>

<p> "We might as well try some bhel puri."  </p>

<p> They spend a couple of their invaluable coupons on buying the bhel
puri and to their surprise the bhel puris were good. </p>

<p> "Talk about surprises! At least it is a pleasant surprise" said Pooja. </p>

<p> Then they tried the sev puri and the paani puri and it was a lot
better than the street sev puris and pani puris. </p>

<p> "Now we do not have to avoid this floor" said Pooja laughing as they
left the food court.  </p>

<p> "Let us play some games" said Kavita. Kavita spend some coupons
throwing darts and she did not win anything. She tried a lucky machine
and she did not win anything. Kavita gave up on the games and was on the
 point of going back to the brain section but Pooja was in the middle
 of some guessing game which she was pretty convinced she would win. So
 Kavita just waited outside in the veranda and watched the merry go rounds
 and giant wheels. </p>

<p> Suddenly she saw Amar standing near a giant wheel talking to
somebody. Kavita decided to go and talk to him. </p>

<p> "Hello" said Kavita when she reached where Amar was standing. </p>

<p> At first Amar kept his eyes fixed to the ground totally ignoring her. </p>

<p> "Hello" said Kavita again a little concerned that Amar might have forgotten
her. She was on the verge of going back when Amar lifted his eyes shyly
and said "Hello." </p>

<p> "Good to see you here" said Kavita. </p>

<p> Amar was at a loss of words. It seemed like he wanted to disappear or
something. So Kavita decided to go look for Pooja for she did not want
to bother Amar. </p>

<p> "Good to see you. Hope you have a nice day" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "Good to see you" muttered Amar. </p>

<p> "Have a great day" said Kavita as she returned to the brain section. </p>


<p> When Kavita got back to the brain section, she managed to gather a
little crowd around her. After pointing to the chart of the nervous
system Kavita got to her favorite part of opening up the head of a
brain model and giving it to the audience to check the cerebrum and
cerebellum. </p>

<p> "How nice" said a little girl.   </p>

<p> "How interesting" said a little boy. </p>

<p> The brain model went around the little crowd and Kavita took a pause and
waited for the brain model to come back to her. </p>

<p> "Would Amar turn up for a brain demonstration?" Kavita pondered. </p>

<p> She could not make up her mind about whether she would be happy if Amar
turned up for the demonstration. He looked smarter than necessary
and that was a deterrent. She did not want him to somehow trivialize
her important assignments. At the same time she did want to see him.
She always looked forward to seeing him. And shortly after wards Amar
did turn up. </p>

<p> "We can see the medulla oblangata" said a little girl happily.
The children were matching the chart and the brain model quite
accurately and this gave Kavita a thrill. </p>

<p> "It is a pretty good model" said Amar holding the brain model up. </p>

<p> "We can see the Pons Varoli. We can also see the Brachium Pontis"
said Amar very excited. </p>

<p> Now Kavita did not know what these objects were and her brain chart
did not say anything about Brachium pontis. At one time she even
thought he might be making these words up and that made her
angry. There was no way she could verify that he was telling the truth
and he could be easily playing a joke on her.  He went on to describe
transverse fibers, arcuate fibers, anterior fissure, and so on for a
good ten minutes. That is when Kavita felt like laughing. It did not
sound like anything related to a brain and somehow Amar did not look
so daunting anymore.  In fact it looked more like he was making up all
these terms just to entertain. The crowd of children gathered
started to laugh too. </p>

<p> Amar who was at a loss of words usually, now was more at a loss of
words than ever. He decided to sit quietly and he made a lot of
faces. Kavita had never seen anyone make so many faces in her life. It
surprised her a little to see Amar making all those faces.  Kavita was
wondering how to react to Amar's faces. Maybe she should make a few
faces too. She gave up on that idea and decided to ignore Amar and
continue with the brain talk. Soon Amar left the spot and Kavita felt
sorry. It was so rare that she got to see Amar and he was making all
these faces for no apparent reason.  And now he was gone. </p>

"Oh! Well! Men are nothing but trouble" Kavita concluded. </p>
