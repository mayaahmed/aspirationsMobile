<h3> Chapter 5  </h3>
<h2>A Malayali Wedding </h2>

<p>        The exhibition ended and like many other things that year, the ending
of a school exhibition was a sad event. It meant she had to move on
and the stress of the nearing Board exam was the only thing that prevented
Kavita from becoming gloomy.  She was busy. Anyone who met her these
days would first ask her how her preparations for the board exam was going.
Admissions to colleges were competitive  and tough. Kavita tried her best
to look very concerned. But on many occasions when she was alone she
found her books tedious to read and she could not care less how she
did her exams. </p>

<p>  "Look at the pictures of the students that came in the merit list
last year. I cut these pictures for you. If your name comes in the
merit list, I will be so proud" her mother said. </p>

<p>  "High hopes, ma. I hope I pass" said Kavita. </p>

<p>  "You could come in the merit list. You only have to work hard" her
mother said. </p>

<p>  "No way I can work that hard" said Kavita firmly.</p>

<p> "You could, if you tried" her mother said really disappointed. Looking
at her mother's sad face, Kavita almost had an urge to try to make it
to the merit list. But one look at the books in front her made her
soon forget that the thought ever occurred to her. </p>

<p> "Three more months to go!" sighed Kavita. </p>

<p> The sun was setting and evenings often made Kavita pensive. Another
day was up and she felt she had not got much done. She could have
worked more. The board exams were near. </p>

<p> "Switch on the lights, Kavita. It will get dark soon. One should turn
on the lights before other people always" said her mother. </p>

<p> "Why?" asked Kavita. </p>

<p> "I don't know. People say like that" her mother said. </p>

<p> "If everyone tried to switch lights on before everyone else
then we would never be able to switch lights off" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "One should be reasonable about one's superstitions. You don't have
to get carried away with the idea" scolded Kavita's mother. </p>

<p> "How come you believe in all these superstitions without
figuring out what they signify?" asked Kavita. </p>

<p> "Don't argue. If you do not want to switch the lights on, just say so.
I will do it myself" said her mother. </p>

<p> "I will do it, mother. Just wondering. That is all" said Kavita. </p>

<p> Kavita turned on the lights of the first room. That was the room that
should be lit. The rule did not apply to other rooms of the
house. Kavita went out and stood in the balcony. There was a cold wind
blowing.  She could see people hurrying back home. Mostly men
returning from work with packages in their hands. The number of
children playing in the playgrounds was constantly dwindling. There
was some logic in switching on the lights before the sun set. Some of
the houses that were not lit yet appeared gloomy. The lights made
everything alive. Kavita watched the birds settling down in large
numbers on the trees for the night. Birds of so many different kinds
rested in harmony on the same tree for the night. Why did this harmony
exist? Nature was strange in its ways.  Where one expected conflict
there was harmony, and where one expected harmony there was conflict. </p>

<p> "I am going to Pooja's house. I need a walk" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "Come back soon. It will get really dark soon" said Kavita's mother. </p>

<p> Kavita and Pooja walked around the building a few times before deciding
to settle on a cement seat in front of the building. The cement seat
was popular and was rarely vacant. </p>

<p> "So many people are outside their homes at this time of the day.
Why?" asked Kavita. </p>

<p> "I think people are taking leave of each other. As they retire to
their homes for the night they are taking leave of their
neighbors. Or maybe they are exchanging notes about the day's
proceedings. Who knows? We should one day do a survey on what these
women are discussing in the evenings" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "One has to pause a little in the evenings. The electric lights
replace the sunlight and soon it makes no difference in the modern
world whether it is day or night. But there is a little intermission
and one reluctantly notices the change. A day is spend and life goes
on" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "Boy! What is wrong with you?" asked Pooja. </p>

<p> "It is all this studying. I want to avoid thinking about my school
work and my mind goes on all these tangents. It happens more when
exams are nearing" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "What about Amar? Is he a pleasant distraction still?" 
asked Pooja laughing. </p>

<p> "Not after he made all those faces" said Kavita laughing. "Those faces
were unwarranted. Did he seriously expect people to know what the Pons
Varoli of the brain was?" </p>

<p> "Never laugh at a man when he is trying to appear smart. It is
no trivial thing to know what pons varoli of the brain is" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "It reminds me of a poem someone wrote which says that when a man
thinks of you with anger and his words have turned bitter then it is
time to let him go" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "I wonder where making faces fits in this framework" said Pooja. </p>

<p>  "Who knows? I know of no poems on a man making faces. This sure is a new
phenomenon" said Kavita. </p>
 
<p> "It sure is" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "I know of no poems that talk about Pons varoli either" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "Now what exactly is Pons varoli? What is its function?" asked Pooja. </p>

<p> "Beats me. That piques my interest. So I am going back to hit my
biology books" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "Me too" said Pooja and the two girls went back home to study. </p>

<p> When Kavita got home her mother was busy reading letters.  Kavita's
mother had advertised in the newspaper for a husband for her
sister. Every day ten or twenty letters would come by mail and 
once in a while her mother sorted out the letters she would reply to. </p>

<p> "I selected these ten letters to reply to" said Kavita's mother. </p>

<p> Kavita browsed the letters her mother had selected. </p>

<p> "This man wants to know the details of dowry? Isn't  dowry illegal?
We should notify the police about this man" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "I do not think asking for dowry is illegal. Harassing someone for
dowry is illegal" clarified Kavita's mother. </p>

<p> "I can check with the police" said Kavita offering her help. </p>

<p> "Keep out of this Kavita. Why are you talking about the police when
someone is arranging a marriage? Talk auspiciously" scolded Kavita's
mother. </p>

<p> "Alright" said Kavita.  </p>

<p> She looked through the letters her mother had rejected. </p>

<p> "Why are these rejected?" asked Kavita. </p>

<p> "They are not Malayali Christians like us" said her mother.  </p>

<p> "This man is a Malayali Christian" said Kavita really happy to be
of help for a change.   </p>

<p> "We  belong to a different sect.  They are protestants" explained
her mother. </p>

<p> Kavita's mother then went on to explain how they were Brahmins who
were converted to Christianity by Saint Thomas himself.  </p>

<p> "What if all that is a lie? There is no proof" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "There is plenty of proof that Saint Thomas came to Kerala.
It is in the bible" said her mother.  </p>

<p> "May be" said Kavita. "But there is no proof he converted our
forefathers. Also there is no proof that he converted
Brahmins. Anyways, mother, Christ himself preferred
fishermen. Fishermen are not among the higher castes in Kerala. On
second thoughts I am convinced that our forefathers were fishermen."  </p>

<p> "The very idea! We are the Syro Malabar people. We are converted by
Saint Thomas himself" said her mother angrily.  </p>

<p> Kavita decided to let go of the argument. She watched her mother write
letters describing the virtues of her aunt and the details of the
dowry. This was Mumbai and there was no way one could check the caste
of a person. One Thomas was as good as any. They came from Kerala to
try their fortune in a new land called Mumbai. The Malayali people
were a hard working lot and were a preferred work force in Mumbai
offices. The matrimonial advertisements in the daily newspaper Times
of India was very much an acquired culture of the Mumbai
Malayalis. But it worked very well. Within a few weeks Kavita's aunt
was getting married.  </p>

<p> Kavita's mother and aunt went with the boy's family to pick up two
saris. A white sari her aunt would wear for the wedding and a cream
silk sari with red border that she would wear for the reception.  </p>

<p> "Only two saris?" asked Nutan who was Kavita's neighbor.  </p>

<p> "Yes. It is not like Hindu weddings. Christian weddings are very
simple" explained Kavita.  </p>

<p> "I am sure it is. Even the reception sari has such mild color compared
to the vibrant yellows and reds of a Hindu wedding" said Nutan.  </p>

<p> "So it is" said Kavita. She was not sure whether she was happy about
that fact. Why was Christian weddings so simple? But the Kerala Hindu
weddings were quite simple too. It was shorter than Kerala christian
weddings.  </p>

<p> "Why are the people of Kerala so simple? Why are we not grand like
others?"  Kavita asked her mother. </p>

<p> "That is our culture. We are simple people" her mother said. </p>

<p> "But why is our culture like that? Why don't we apply turmeric and
sandalwood paste before a wedding? Why don't we put bright red
kumkums on our forehead?" asked Kavita. </p>

<p> "I have work to do" said her mother and quickly disappeared. </p>

<p> But on the wedding day, Kavita's aunt looked pretty in a white sari,
with a little white crown on her head, and a white bouquet of flowers
in her hand. </p>

<p> "I wish we had little crowns to wear in our weddings" said Nutan. </p>

<p> "That is life. Everyone wishes for  what they do not have. Man
is never satisfied" said Kavita. </p>

<p> Kavita's aunt did not look bad in the cream sari either. Plenty of
gold ornaments made up for the simplicity of the sari.  When the
wedding was over her aunt left with her newly wedded husband in a car
decorated with rose flowers. </p>

<p> "I guess every culture has its charm. Also every culture knows what
works best for it" said Kavita. </p>

<p> Kavita wondered what was the image of herself as a bride. A red sari
with a bindi on her forehead and jasmines in the hair like a Hindu
bride or would she be in a white sari with a bouquet in her hand? Why
did she assume she had a choice? Kavita realized that she had never
bracketed herself as a Malayali girl destined to marry a Malayali
man. She was free and she cherished the thought.  And to her surprise,
she also realized that she did not like the image of herself as a
bride at all. Marriage seemed unpalatable to her. It was okay to see
others dressed up like a doll and walking in to slavery. That was not
a fate she wished for herself. And somehow after that thought the
books in front of her looked more inviting than ever. Education was
the key to true freedom. Tedious though the path maybe, freedom of
spirit was worth the trouble.  </p>
