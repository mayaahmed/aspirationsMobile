<h3> Chapter 15  </h3>
<h2>Scolding Professors  </h2>

<p> People in academia were polite in America in the nineties. Professors
in mathematics were usually always smiling and would go out of their
way to help students. On the contrary Indian professors behaved like
scolding parents. Arti clearly did not know how to deal with
scolding people. </p>

<p> "This is all wrong. This is not the solution" said Sharma giving
Arti back her papers. </p>

<p> "Why is it wrong?" asked Arti.  Arti had done this problem before and
she knew it was correct as far as she could tell. Her professor in
America had given her full points for the very same solution. Did he
make a mistake? </p>

<p> "It is all wrong. You can ask the other graduate students why it is
wrong" said Sharma closing the topic. </p>

<p> Sharma in his high chair behind a large desk looked intimidating.
She felt very small with the papers and the undergraduate
book in her hand with which she could prove that she was right.
But Sharma was in a position where at his whim he could close
a conversation. She could tell him anything more only if he
desired to hear more. And clearly he did not. He started talking to
the other students and Arti formed a little smile with her lips
and waited for the meeting to end. </p>

<p> Once out of the building, Arti had to face her feelings. She felt
humiliated. She felt that she never wanted to go back to that building
again. She walked back to the rickshaw stand and she met her friend
Mythili. </p>

<p> "Hey, Arti. What happened to your smiling face? What are you thinking
about?" asked Mythili. </p>

<p> "Sharma acted very rude towards me today. I do not know how to deal
with it" said Arti. </p>

<p> "Don't take that to heart, Arti. Advisers are always scolding students.
My Adviser scolds me everyday. Luckily the students have a very strong
support system here. We tell each others our woes and that makes us feel
a lot better. Stop by and talk to us if you are feeling bad about anything.
We are here for you" said Mythili. </p>

<p> Soon Chitra joined the group and when she heard about Arti's predicament,
she laughed and said </p>

<p> "That is an adviser's job. They scold and scold. No big deal." </p>

<p> "Thanks. Talking to you made me feel much better" said Arti. </p>

<p> "Hey, talk to us about anything you like. Just stop by. We are here
all the time" said Mythili. </p>

<p> "Thank you for your support" said Arti. </p>

<p>  But on the way back home in the rickshaw, Arti realised that she had
not felt better. She did not like being scolded. It was not easy for
her to forget either. And again that feeling of never wanting to go
back to the math building returned. Tears started swelling her eyes
and it would not stop flowing. She was sitting in this open rickshaw
and the rickshaw was passing through real crowded streets of
Bangalore. It was not right to be crying like this but she could not
help it. The rickshawalla was a young boy and he was confused and he
turned back to look. He wanted to say some kind words or ask what the
problem was. But his position would not allow him to talk to her and
he decided to keep quiet. And all through the journey through the
streets of Bangalore tears flowed till Arti reached Kabir's office.
She paid the rickshawalla his money and asked the watchman to call
Kabir. When Kabir came down, he met with a real angry Arti. </p>

<p>  "Why did we have to leave America? Why did I have to leave school?
Why do you have to roam around like this?" and many other such
questions flew at Kabir. Kabir could only laugh. </p>

<p>  "I am not going back to that school again" said Arti. </p>

<p> "You are over reacting. All these are normal things. You should not
let such small things bother you so much" said Kabir. </p>

<p> "I don't care. I am not going back" said Arti. </p>

<p>  Arti did not go to school the next day. Kabir got back from office and
said </p>

<p> "You must go. Give it a try. This is not the end of the world." </p>

<p> "No. Don't talk to me about school. Don't talk to me about math.
I want to have nothing to do with it" said Arti. </p>

<p> A few days later, Arti was dusting her house. She stopped at her book
rack. There it was her math books inviting her to open them. She
picked up her favorite book. </p>

<p> "No. I will not give up so easily. May be there is a place somewhere
in the Math world for me. I must find out" said Arti. </p>

<p> She went to school the very next day. </p>

<p> "Where were you?" asked Sharma. </p>

<p> "I was sick" lied Arti. </p>

<p> "I am glad to hear you are fine now. And you are here on a very good
day. Today Jatin is giving a talk in five minutes. He is a great
speaker.  You will like the talk" said Sharma.  </p>

<p> It was clear Sharma had not given a second thought to the scolding he
had given Arti. It meant nothing to him and it meant so much to Arti.
That was his style or maybe that was the general style. His Adviser
had scolded him and he had survived it and his students would survive
too. Anyways all this was good for them. </p>

<p> Sharma was right. Jatin's talk was very good. And Arti returned home
quite happy that day. </p>
