<h3> Chapter 7  </h3>
<h2>The Big Bad Exams</h2>

<p> The board exams finally arrived. Kavita had to go to a different
school to give the exams.  For the board exams, one did not have to
wear school uniforms, so Kavita spend a considerable time picking up
clothes for the six days the exams lasted. Clothes were a big deal in
a young girl's life. Kavita kept her identity card carefully in her
bag and checked it time and again. The identity card was supposed to
be kept carefully till the exam results were announced. It was a small
delicate piece of paper with her photograph on it. Towards the end of
the exams the identity card had come apart in pieces. </p>

<p> There were students from other schools in the classroom she had her
exams in and soon they all had become friends. There was a lot
cheating going on around her. The peon would help by bringing small
chits of paper to some rich students after the exams had begun for the
bribes they paid him. Many of the not so rich kids carried their own
chits of paper. Kavita could see clearly that all was not fair in how
the exams were being conducted but the authorities saw nothing. Was it
that they really did not see the cheating or was it that they decided
to do nothing about it? Kavita could not tell. But Kavita could care
less about all the happenings around her since it was not her job to
bring in order to the exam proceedings. She was there only to take the
exams and she decided to mind her own affairs. </p>

<p> But just before her Geometry exam, the Principal of the school, which
was now serving as the exam center, turned up in the classroom and
asked </p>

<p> "Is Kavita in this classroom?" </p>

<p> "Yes" replied Kavita. </p>

<p> "I need to talk to you about something. Please come to
my office after this exam" said the principal gravely. </p>

<p> Kavita's heart missed a beat. Had she done something wrong?
The other day a friend was asking her the answers to the match
the following questions and she had sort of helped out. Is that
the reason she was called to the Principal's office today? She was
very good at Geometry and the exam was easy but her mind was
worried. She was glad when the exam was over and she hurried to
the Principal's office. </p>

<p> When she entered the office, the principal asked her </p>

<p> "Have you noticed any cheating in the exam hall?" asked the principal. </p>

<p> "I don't know. I guess there must be some stuff going on. I don't know
anything about it" said Kavita baffled. </p>

<p> "I heard from your cousin that you told him that you noticed some
cheating going on" said the principal. </p>

<p> "My cousin? Which cousin?" asked Kavita. </p>

<p> "He had a beard" said the principal. </p>

<p>  "I have no such cousin. Someone has been lying about me" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "That is strange. He said he was your cousin. So you did not notice
anything strange in the exam halls, have you?" asked the principal.</p> 

<p>  "No, I was concentrating on my own exams" said Kavita.</p>

<p>  "Okay. That is alright. If you notice something strange let me know.
I will take action" said the principal smiling.</p>

<p>  "Well,.." began Kavita.</p>

<p>  "It is a misunderstanding I suppose. Nothing serious yet" said the
principal now really grinning.</p>

<p>  Kavita left the room really angry. The grinning principal had messed
up her geometry exam. She had half a mind to take the duster and hit
him on the head with it as he stood there grinning. But what could she
do? He seemed like a giant and she was really a young student. She
went back to her desk to take the next exam of the day and the
students gathered around her to ask why she was summoned to the
Principal's office.</p>

<p>  "I think the tale of your cousin is fiction. The principal wanted to
find out and he was playing a trick on you" said one girl.</p>

<p>  "Deepak from the other classroom was summoned yesterday and he spilled
the beans about the peon" said Radha. "Now the peon, if he gets into
trouble, will hold you suspect. He is supposed to be dangerous." </p>

<p> "Why me?" asked Kavita now really annoyed. "Why do I have to be
trapped between a nincompoop grinning principal and a dangerous bribed
peon? But if any of those two try any funny business with me I am
going to hit them on the head with the first thing I see."</p>

<p>"Boy! You are brave" said Pooja.</p>

<p> "Brave my foot! Just plain annoyed" said Kavita.</p>

<p> After a couple of days there were many rumors about how the peon was
on track of people who squealed about him and how some people's very
lives were in danger. But the exams had passed peacefully after that.
The principal always greeted Kavita warmly on the corridor as though
they were best friends but Kavita did not feel any friendly feelings
toward him. He had messed up her Geometry exam. The peon did not have
much to say either. Even if someone had squealed about him it made no
difference to his life. He brought the chits dutifully each day to
those who bribed him and life went on.</p>
