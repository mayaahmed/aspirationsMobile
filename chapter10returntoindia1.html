<h3> Chapter 10  </h3>
<h2>Flying home to India </h2>

<p> Arti was flying back to India from America with her husband Kabir. It
was the nineties. Getting visas to live in America was difficult. The
couple had just left a dream life of millions of people living in
India who would do anything to go to America. It had been a good stay
in America. There were plenty of opportunities and good money to be
made. Kabir held a dream job and Arti went to the best of schools. But
there was a nagging discontent. The couple always felt that there was
something wrong about leaving India for a better life. It was as
though they were neglecting an old parent. They made plans to go back
to India often. And finally they took the plunge and here they were
heading back to the world they had left behind six years ago. </p>


<p> "Maybe I denied myself the right to miss India" said Kabir. "Only when
I begin to go towards India that I realize that how much I have missed
home and India."  </p>

<p> "We lose ourselves in work to avoid the fact that we are missing out
on real life" said Arti. "Many times we don't  realize it. The
rich web of relations and emotions is essential to make life
meaningful. Though I may not be up to facing the emotional turmoils of
everyday life in India." </p>

<p>  Arti and Kabir were young hot tickets with nothing to worry
about. Opportunities to pick and choose were assured wherever they
went. Kabir was taking up a job in Bangalore and Arti would continue
her studies. But first she would go home to her parents. Her family
was there at the airport to meet her. It had been six long years.  She
really had missed them big time. This was like a dream and Arti smiled
to herself. Six years and she had not seen these faces she loved so
much. When she got home she did not feel like doing anything. She just
sat and watched everyone buzzing around. Many things had changed and
it took getting used to. Her pet dog had died while she was away. Her
little brother was married. Her parents had moved to a new house. A
lot of things were different now including herself. </p>

<p>  Neighbors came to visit her. These were people she had known as a
child. </p>

<p> "How are you? How is America?" asked Masi. </p>

<p> "Fine, fine" said Arti.  </p>

<p> Words failed her but she was happy to see Masi. Arti's mother bought
out some chocolates and a few other things and put it in a small bag
and gave it to Masi. </p>

<p> "You must take these chocolates for the children.  Arti brought this
from America" said Arti's mother.  </p>

<p> Masi was quite happy with the little packet she got. Masi asked Arti </p>

<p> "Where is your husband?" </p>

<p> "He will be here today" replied Arti's mother. </p>

<p> "Oh, that is why you are so busy preparing so many things?" asked
Masi. </p>

<p> "Yes.  After all one has to treat one's son in law well" said Arti's
mother. </p>

<p> "That is true. That is true. So you will settle down in Mumbai?" asked
Masi. </p>

<p> "No, they are going to Bangalore" said Arti's mother. </p>

<p> "That is too bad. You should settle down in Mumbai. Then you can visit
home more often" said Masi. </p>

<p> "It is better than America. I can see my child more often now" said
Arti's mother. </p>

<p> Arti's mother was answering all the questions for her but Arti
did not mind. She just sat smiling at everybody and she felt very
happy. </p>

<p> "I am so happy to be home" said Arti again. She found herself saying
this line over and over again. "I have met more people in two days
than all the people I met in America in six years." </p>

<p>It was strange to find her little brother married. He was entertaining
his friends like a grown man. For Arti he remained a little boy but
she had to show deference in front of his wife. Arti's mother offered
tea to the visitors but they were hesitant since it was a hot day. </p>

<p> "I will make you some herbal tea" said Arti all too happy to introduce
people to something new. Not many people drank herbal tea in
India. Now she would introduce it to the little crowd gathered in
their living room. </p>

<p> Arti made some black tea, poured it in to fancy cups, and offered it to
everyone. If Arti had a little doubt that people would not like the
herbal tea she made then she was not wrong at all.  People were making
all sorts of contorted faces after the first sip they drank. </p>

<p> "How can you call this tea? This tastes more like medicine" someone said. </p>

<p> "Hey, this is the way hundreds of people drink tea in America. You
just need an open mind to enjoy it. Now try another sip. The first sip
is always a surprise. It is all a matter of getting used to a new
taste" said Arti now certain that she had given them the necessary
psychological setup to enjoy something new like herbal tea. But the
verdict was that herbal tea was no good. In fact the subject of herbal
tea became a topic of great mirth for a few weeks after that day.  One
just had to say herbal tea and Arti's brother's friends would begin
laughing. </p>

<p> "It was my mistake trying to introduce you junglees to world cuisine.
See whether I will ever try that again" said Arti angrily. </p>

<p> Time seemed to fly and soon it was time to go to Bangalore. </p>

<p> "It is one journey after the other. Bangalore is as foreign to me as
America" whispered Arti to Kabir in the plane. </p>

<p> "One day we will settle down. But now we must explore and see the
world. And with you beside me, I feel I am always home" said Kabir
smiling at her. </p>

<p> The plane food was excellent. It was food she understood. </p>

<p> "It is nice to know the history of what you are eating" said
Arti. "This vada-pao in the tray is street food of Mumbai though it is
stylishly presented when served in the plane. If you did not know
this, it did not matter much. But it just good to know what you know"
said Arti. </p>

<p> "You know these details only if you are Indian. We know a lot about
India. It is only when you have been away that you realize it" said
Kabir. </p>

<p> When they landed in Bangalore Kabir's company people were waiting for
him with his name written on a welcome sign board. They offered Arti a
big bouquet of flowers and took them to the motel they were going to
stay in. It was the best motel in all of Bangalore. </p>

<p> "Next week we will hunt for a house. Tomorrow I will go to the
office and see what it is like" said Kabir. </p>

<p> They sat in the balcony of the motel and watched the sunset. It was a
new life they were facing together again. </p>

<p> "I am at at peace in India" said Arti. </p>

<p> "People are made of the sand, air, and water of the place they live
in" said Kabir. "We are in sync in the place we were born. Hence we
are at peace here." </p>

<p> "The bible says that you are dust and to dust thou shall return" said
Arti. "It makes sense. The plants create food out of sand, air, and
water.  The food chain begins with plants and thus we are made of the
sand, air, and water of the land we live in."  </p>

<p> "By that logic we are made of the sand, air, and water of all the
places we visit" said Kabir. "Some of us are made of international
sand, air, and water." </p>

<p> But  for Arti six years of American soil was dominated by
decades of Indian soil. </p>

<p> "There was India with me wherever I went" said Arti. "I created a
little India everywhere I went around me. But being in India is
different. When it is my turn to return to dust it is India's dust I
want to return to." </p>
