<h3> Chapter 17  </h3>
<h2> America becomes home </h2>

<p> When Arti got back to the US everything was intact. The opportunities
and the attitudes were all good just like before. The smell of the
dish washing soap and the rugs in the rooms were all familiar. She
never realized before how much America had become home. Arti found it
quite easy to get in to a routine. Soon she was back in to a PhD
program and got very busy again. </p>

<p> However she had to live alone because she got admissions in an
university which was located a hundred miles away from where Kabir
worked.  They met only on weekends.  Living alone in a strange city
was a little scary and the best thing to do was to keep a low
profile. She kept all the curtains drawn.  Inside the house she felt
safe.  Most of her days were spend cooped up inside the house typing
on the computer keyboard. She played old Hindi movie songs loudly.
That was perhaps the only sign the neighbors had of her existence.
She rarely stepped out except to go to school.  </p>

 <p> It was great that she had this quiet time for her work but in no way
was this life ideal.  Arti spoke to very few people.  There were a few
Indian students.  The Indian students in general tried to meet each
other and form some sort of community.  Arti toyed with the idea about
joining the group.  But the idea did not appeal to her much. You could
not become friends only because you were born in the same country.
When Arti was with Americans, she had to be cautious. Culture shocks
were part of most of her experiences. This caution spelled doom for
any kind of real friendships. She was not comfortable with pajama
parties or beer drinking bouts.  When she tried to socialize she felt
out of place and she really missed India.  Most of the times she stood
out as a curiosity. The way she furnished her house or the food she
cooked was all a novelty to her neighbors.  Even the things she bought
in America had a distinct Indian flavor to it.  She soon got tired of
representing India to everyone around her and became more and more
busy with her work. She concluded that there were fundamental
differences between her and other people that would probably never
change. </p>

<p> The ideal way to spend time under the given conditions was with her
books, her music, her thoughts, and her computer.  The only real
connection she made with people was with mathematics.  She enjoyed her
work and that was why she was here. This was the story of most
immigrants especially the Indian immigrants. They had no life outside
their work. Arti's books surrounded her while she slept.  Her dining
table and every other reasonable spot was filled with papers and open
books. All her celebrations now were related to her work. </p>

<p> "My oral exams are next week" said Arti. "I will be glad if I clear
it." </p>

<p> "We will hold a mock exam for you if you buy us beer" her office mate
Shirley said. </p>

<p> "I can surely do that" said Arti. </p>

<p> A few graduate students held a mock exam for Arti. The questions were
very tough and at the end of it all Arti was convinced she would never
clear the oral exam in her life time. She went back and studied day
and night. But the actual oral exam was a lot easier than the mock
exam and Arti did quite well. Arti bought beer for her friends. But
she bought one too many beer cans. Moreover her colleagues brought a
lot of beer for her. Neither Arti nor Kabir liked beer. At the end of
the party all her kitchen shelves were filled with beer. And the news
came that her parents were going to visit her soon. </p>

<p> "My house is full of beer" said Arti. "My parents will think I have
become a drunkard." </p>

<p> "Easy enough" said Shirley. "Send an email to the Grad students
group. The beer will go quickly. Who can refuse free beer?" </p>

<p> Sure enough within a day the beer problem was solved. This was her
life.  She was almost free to do anything she wanted. Maybe smoke a
cigar and drink herself to sleep though she never did any of those
things. This freedom was mind boggling. </p>


<p> The sink was full of vessels she had not washed for a couple of
days. And just before Kabir would arrive on weekends, she would clean
up the place.  Oh! People or husband!  Let us see what they had to
say. They had plenty to say starting from how she should look, or how
she should talk, or even think.  It was a bother to have people even
Kabir around. But also it was abnormal to enjoy solitude so much. If
she were to be alone forever, she would tire of the solitude. But
things as it stood she was enjoying every moment of it. </p>

<p> But one day everything changed. The 911 happened. And America was in a
state of war. The economy began to crumble but Arti was not affected
by it yet. Traveling by air became an unpleasant experience. There
was an environment of suspicion especially towards people of brown
skin. Students from Arab regions returned home in large numbers.
Traveling outside of USA was risky for an immigrant however legal
their status was.  There were so many stories of people spending
months stranded because some paper work was not completed. Arti hated
the very thought of being stranded any where. She was like a cat in
the matter of space.  Everywhere she went she would find a spot that
she liked and stick to that spot as much as she could and she chose
her spots with great care. And once out of home, her greatest desire
was always to get back home. Being stranded anywhere was definitely
not her cup of tea. </p>

<p> But she was a researcher and she needed to travel to attend
conferences. Her strategy was to never get into any kind of conflict
at the airports. It was unpleasant to watch some man open your luggage
and look through your unwashed clothes or have him do a pat down on
you. These things were new at US airports but people began getting
used to it. Every one like herself would rather get back to the
comforts of their own homes. A lot of innocent people were getting
dragged in to a conflict that had nothing to do with them. It reminded
her of India. </p>

<p> On one such trip, Arti waited impatiently in line to get her boarding
pass at the Canadian airport. When she got to the counter, the clerk
looked at her passport and with a severe face asked her to wait. </p>

<p> "Your name is Arti Hassan" said the clerk. "This name has to be
checked for security reasons."  </p>

<p> Arti was made to wait and a few airport security guards with guns came
and gaped at her. </p>

<p> "Do you know why we asked you to wait?" asked a security guard. </p>

<p> Arti checked her sense of humor. The airports had signs saying that
joking could land her in jail. Arti thought of what her family would
think if they heard that she went to jail for telling a joke. Also the
stories of film actors from India who gave wrong answers being stuck
at the airport and made to miss flights were reasons enough for Arti to
mellow down. </p>

<p>  "I believe these are security checks" said Arti. </p>

<p>  "Yes. Moreover your name is dangerous" said a guard.  </p>

<p>  Did that make sense? Did she look dangerous? Never in her life had any
one found her dangerous. Not a single person in her entire family
looked dangerous. What was this guard talking about? The security
guards looked at her as though she was a criminal. They were very
unfriendly for the only reason that they did not like her name. Arti
was in general a very friendly person and people smiled all around her
wherever she went. These group of Canadian guards thought differently
and definitely there would be no smiles.  Arti waited patiently as
more security guards looked at her passport and finally she was
grateful that they were letting her board her plane. </p>

<p>  "The status of an immigrant  does not really let you express
your opinions"  thought Arti for  now she had to  go through
another interview with another grim immigration officer. She
told herself that she was glad there were no bows and arrows
greeting her which was  what ancient travelers faced. These
were  just   routine  checks  of   documents  though  rather
unfriendly.  It was  Arti's  habit to  compare  all her  bad
situations  to   a  worse  scenario  for   that  eased  her
discomfort. And finally she was boarding the plane back home
to a little apartment in California. </p>

<p>  It was good to be home. It did not matter where in the world she
was. The space she called home was always the best place to be.  The
walls kept her safe, away from immigration officers, security people,
or other annoyances. Here she was, in California, her possessions
amounting to a few racks of books, which were the first to be junked
if she did not have a husband who could afford to rent the space she
called home. </p>

<p> The  process of immigration had changed  Arti forever and
either now she  had two homes or she had  none. When she was
in India,  she would  feel homesick when  she saw  the green
signboards of the American highways in movies just like she
would miss garlands of jasmine flowers of India when she was
in America. Immigration involved major upheavals and with it
came a great deal of unrest.  </p>
