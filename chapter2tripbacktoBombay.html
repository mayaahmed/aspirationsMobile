<h3> Chapter 2  </h3>
<h2>Back in Mumbai </h2>
        
<p> On the train trip back to Mumbai most of the sacks that contained
gifts of food from relatives were tucked under the seats.  A couple of
sacks were placed in the top berth which was where Kavita spend most
of her time. The sacks were bothering Kavita and it took a while for
her to get comfortable. She opened a book and tried to read.  It was
no use. She could not forget her relatives. </p>

<p> She got down from the berth and looked out of the train. She sighed
 about the long journey. It would be a couple of days more before she
 reached Mumbai. Kavita's father was buying some tea from the tea
 seller and he asked Kavita </p>

<p> "Do you want some tea?" </p>

<p> "No. That tea tastes like water. I do not mind coffee." </p>

<p> "We will try to get you some coffee."  </p>


<p> The tea seller made an angry face at Kavita. He was annoyed that his
 tea was criticized. Kavita was going to tell him that it was common
 knowledge that the tea sold in trains tasted like gutter water when
 her eyes rested on a handsome stranger sitting a few seats away. She
 could not tell what was the expression in his eyes. Was it amusement,
 affection, or sympathy? The expression on the stranger's face
 intrigued her. It caught her attention and she found herself
 searching his soul through his eyes.  His eyes were like a deep ocean
 which seemed to hold a lot of interesting secrets. </p>

<p> She could not tell much about what he was thinking but she liked the
game. Soon she decided to catch his eye again. He was looking at her and
she returned his glare. What she did not account for was the thousands
of invisible arrows that shot at her all at once. Was this what
people called sparks flying between two people? </p>

<p> "This is no game. This is somehow dangerous" Kavita told herself and
she decided to avoid the stranger for the rest of the journey. </p>

<p> But soon he had made friends with her family. He exchanged visiting
cards with her father. He seemed to be able to read Kavita's
mind. When she wanted to look outside a shut window, he would open it
without her uttering a word. When she reached out to get a book, he
would get it for her. It was a strange feeling for her to have someone
read her mind. It was frightening and at the same time quite
pleasant.  Kavita was sorry when it was time for him to go. </p>

<p> "I may not see him again" said Kavita to herself with a shrug. </p>

<p> When the train neared Mumbai, Kavita felt really homesick. It was a
month since she had left Mumbai and she was eager to be back home.
The train passed through the huts and sewage as it made its way to the
Dadar station. It was an ugly sight but so familiar that Kavita found
beauty in the ugliness. When they reached the building Kavita lived,
her joys knew no bounds.  She was happy to be back home. </p>

<p> "Mumbai is the only place to live. I am so glad you moved to Mumbai"
said Kavita giving her father a hug. </p>

<p> "I am not so sure" her father said a little pensively. </p>

<p> The very first thing she did was to write to all the new friends she
had made during her trip. She had promised that she would write very
often and that their friendships would never end. The jackfruits they
had carried with them were cut into pieces and distributed with dry
tapioca pieces, chutney powder, rice laddoos, and banana chips to the
relatives and friends of the family. It was a tradition of Malayalis
in Mumbai to share the food they brought back from Kerala with others. </p>

<p> Soon it was time for Kavita to go to school again. It was her last
year of school and she was sentimental about everything. She put the
nicely covered notebooks and textbooks in her school bag. The soft
brown cover on the books felt good to touch. The smell of the new
books were pleasant. She put the school badge on her new school
uniform. </p>

<p> "This will be the last time I will buy this stupid uniform. Though I
have always hated the way this uniform looks, I am still sorry that I
will be no longer wearing it anymore after this year" said Kavita as
she prepared to go to school. School always started in June and it was
the monsoon season in Mumbai. </p>

<p> "Don't forget to take your umbrella. It will surely rain today" said
Kavita's mother. </p>

<p> But when Kavita left for school with Pooja she had forgotten all about
carrying the umbrella. And the rains came pouring down shortly after
Kavita left her house. The two girls ran and took shelter in a
building nearby. A small group of people were also standing in the
entrance of the building to escape the rain. Some people did not have
umbrellas like Kavita and Pooja, others  waited since umbrellas
were not effective against such heavy rains. It so happened that
Kavita's friend Maria lived in that building. When Maria's mother saw
the two girls she said </p>

<p> "No umbrellas? Come, come I will give you an umbrella. Come, come." </p>

<p> "It is alright. The rain will soon stop" said Kavita. She was a little
hesitant to bother Maria's mother. </p>

<p> "No, no. Come. You can borrow an umbrella from me." </p>

<p> "Thank you very much.  This way we will not be late to school. Thanks
a lot" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "Well, I am not sure. The rain will stop soon..." said Kavita still a
little hesitant about borrowing umbrellas. Kavita did not like the
stress of making sure of not losing a borrowed umbrella. Umbrellas
invariably got lost. But Pooja was very happy with the idea of
borrowing the umbrella. </p>

<p> "We were lucky to meet you" said Pooja. "Thanks a lot for allowing us
to borrow an umbrella." </p>

<p> But once Pooja saw the umbrella Maria's mother was offering her, her
enthusiasm for borrowing umbrellas waned considerably. It was a long
black umbrella which people usually called the grandfather's umbrella. </p>

<p> "This!" gulped Kavita. </p>

<p> "We cannot carry this umbrella to school" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "Why not?" asked Maria's mother. </p>

<p> "It is too big" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "That is good. The two of you will be protected from the rains. Now run
along to school. Otherwise you will be late." </p>

<p> "Thank you very much" said Kavita as politely as she could. </p>

<p> But once they were at a considerable distance from the building Kavita
quickly handed the umbrella to Pooja. But Pooja refused to carry the
umbrella. </p>

<p> "No, I am not carrying it. This is embarrassing. What about my cool image?"
asked Pooja. </p>

<p> "You were the one who went about claiming to be lucky about being able
to borrow umbrellas. Now suffer it" said Kavita giggling. </p>
 
<p> "No you carry it. Maria is a friend of yours" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "No, I wont" said Kavita.</p>

<p> "Okay, then I will leave it on the road" said Pooja. </p>

<p> Pooja left the umbrella on the road. Kavita picked it up and hung it
on Pooja's bag. When Pooja discovered it she left it on the road
again. After all such tricks were exhausted the two girls decided to
do their best to hide the umbrella they were carrying. To make matters
worse there was no more rain that day and the sun was shining bright.
The umbrella created a lot of laughter when others saw it. Nobody
carried umbrellas like that anymore. </p>

<p> "Blame Pooja. She cannot deal with a little rain" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "Ah! You are the one with friends  who have umbrellas
like these" said Pooja. </p>

<p> When the school bell rang the supervisor came to Kavita's class and
made an announcement. </p>

<p> "Your class teacher is not going to be here today. I will ask you to
keep pin drop silence. I am teaching in the next class." </p>

<p> "The teacher is absent today?" asked Ram. </p>

<p> Ram was what people considered a teacher's pet. He was hated for the
fact that he was a teacher's pet.  But the supervisor did not know
this fact because she had never taught Ram before. If Ram had been her
student, he would have been her pet too. But now his remark made her
angry. She scolded </p>

<p> "You Monkey face. Did I not ask you to keep pin drop silence? Can you not
understand English?" </p>

<p> "Well, I was just asking..." Ram tried to speak again. It was his habit to
make sure all the teachers he met noticed him. </p>

<p> "Keep quiet. I want pin drop silence. What is your name?" the supervisor
asked. </p>

<p> "Ram" said Ram. </p>

<p> "I will write down your name, Ram. I want no more trouble from you Ram.
I warn you. I want no more trouble from you" said the supervisor. </p>

<p>  Ram was obviously surprised by this treatment meted out to him. He
decided to keep quiet. But the others did not. As soon as the
supervisor left everyone was roaring with laughter. </p>

<p>  "Monkey face. The supervisor called you a monkey face" said Kavita.</p>

<p>  This made Ram very angry. He took a duster and threw it at Kavita. It
went and hit Pooja. Pooja got angry and she took the grandfather's
umbrella and hit Ram's head with it. </p>

<p>  "Careful. That umbrella is Maria's umbrella. I don't want you breaking it"
said Kavita. </p>

<p>  Ram was not one to suffer in silence. He went after the umbrella now
that he knew the umbrella was precious property. But the girls passed
the umbrella all around the classroom and poor Ram went chasing it. He
let out a hue and cry in the process which brought the supervisor back
to the classroom. The supervisor got really angry with Ram. </p>

<p>  "You. You are making all this noise? Did I not tell you I want pin drop
silence?" asked the supervisor. </p>

<p>  "They called me a monkey face and they hit me with an umbrella" said Ram. </p>

<p> "Who did that?" asked the supervisor. </p>

<p> "Kavita and Pooja" said Ram. </p>

<p> "Okay, you two. Come with me. And you Ram, I want not another word from
you" said the supervisor. </p>

<p> Kavita and Pooja followed the supervisor out of the classroom. </p>

<p> "Ah!  Bring the umbrella along too. Better still, give it to me. You can
take it back after the classes are over. I want no more harm done with
umbrellas here" said the supervisor. </p>

<p> "Where are we going?" asked Pooja. </p>

<p> "Well, you can sit for the history class I am teaching" said the supervisor. </p>

<p> The history class was  interesting but Kavita found herself thinking
about the stranger she met in the train. Would she meet him again? What if
she did meet him again? What was it that she wanted to do if she met him
again? She did not know. But she was sure that she did want to meet him
again.   </p>
