<h3> Chapter 3 </h3>
<h2>Merry Christmas </h2>

<p> Catholics of Mumbai believed that if they went for novenas to Mahim
church for nine weeks in a row then all their wishes would come
true. Kavita was facing her board exams at the end of the year and she
did not want to take any chances. She began going to Mahim church with
her mother. </p>

<p> "Five novenas are done" said Kavita. "Another four novenas and my
exams will go super smooth." </p>

<p> "One also has to study" Kavita's mother warned. </p>

<p> "If one has to study then what is the point of going to novenas?" </p>

<p> "Let god do his work. You must do your work." </p>

<p> "Well, he could waive my work.  If it was really true that if you go
for nine novenas and your wishes come true, then why don't everyone go
to these novenas?" </p>

<p> "It is a secret. Only some people know of this secret. One has to be
lucky to know this secret." </p>

<p> "I do not want to mess up my exams. I will surely go for my nine
novenas." </p>

<p> The church was fascinating with big statues and a great altar. The
statues were covered with hundreds of marigold flower garlands offered
by the devotees. There were a few garlands made of lilies and
roses. Kavita placed a few candles at the feet of a statue and plucked
roses and lilies from a garland.  Her mother plucked a couple of
flowers too and kept it in her purse. </p> 

<p> "Do not choose flowers  like that Kavita. These flowers are for good luck and
you must not be picky and choosy about it"  said Kavita's mother. </p>

<p> "Sorry" said Kavita. Soon she got tired of holding the flowers and she
handed the flowers to her mother for safekeeping. She looked around
her.  The church was mostly filled with women with sad faces. It was
clear that they had some wish dear to their hearts and that is why
they were attending this novena. Kavita asked her mother </p>

<p> "Why are women like this? They are always looking for help from
someone outside. It is either their father, their brothers, or their
husband. In case all that fails then they turn to god. Why are
there more women here wishing, praying, and hoping for something
than men?" </p>

<p> "If you are truly pious you would be concentrating more on your
prayers" Kavita's mother scolded. </p>

<p> "Well, okay" said Kavita. But she could not ignore the worry and
sorrow in the faces of these women. Life in Mumbai was clearly not
easy. Everything was expensive and the salaries were low. The faces of
these women clearly told of the stress of survival. </p>

<p> The way back to the bus stop was  a very unpleasant walk. The
footpath was lined with beggars who were mostly lepers.  They competed
with each other to look worse than their neighbors and that way they
planned to earn more sympathy. Somehow it did not have the desired
effect on Kavita. Kavita was repelled by the sight and the stench. 
She held her breath till all the beggars were out of sight and till
she reached the bus stop. </p>

<p> "I am frightened of these beggars. I hope god will not make my exams
go bad because I feel no compassion for these beggars" said Kavita a
little concerned. </p>

<p> "How your exams go will not be based on your compassion for beggars. You
need to just study. Those are separate issues" her mother said. </p>

<p> "Thank god for that. But I wonder why life can get that bad. If there
is a god why do those people suffer so? Why are their lives so
miserable?" asked Kavita. </p>

<p> "A person is responsible to himself for how he chooses to live his
life.  God might help but you sketch your own destiny. So study hard
if you want your life to get anywhere" her mother answered. </p>

<p> "Well, okay" said Kavita. </p>

<p> Study hard! That was easy to say. Now how would studying help in
ensuring a happy life? Kavita could not tell but that seemed to be the
mantra everyone was chanting around her. Moreover there was this
motivation aspect. She felt she was staring at pages and pages of
utter nonsense. And what about these learned people around her? Her
teachers! They did not lead very impressive lives.  Kavita had read
about great scientists. She looked up to Madam Curie as her role
model. She wanted to do something which would make the world think her
special. The only way she could see was to do her studies well. But
she wondered about what motivated the great people of the world. To be
a great scientist must be good fun but Kavita found no motivation
apparent in her school books. But study she must for the exams were
near. </p>

<p> Kavita spend most of her time studying for the board exams. She worked
alone and she worked with friends. The more she studied the more there
was to study. It was not easy on a teenager to spend all her time
staring at books. She decided to forget about her studies for sometime
and decided to think about the handsome stranger she had met in the
train. It was pleasant to think about him and she wondered whether he
thought about her too. She did think of him often. Why did she think
of him often? She hardly knew him. She could not tell. </p>

<p> "Why would that stranger think of me? I do not know why I am thinking
of him. But it sure is pleasant to think about him than worrying about
the nearing exam" said a grinning Kavita to Pooja.  </p>

<p> "Forget all that. Concentrate on your studies, Kavita. This year is crucial
for our future" said Pooja.  </p>

<p> "You bet! You are hundred percent right" said Kavita and stared at the book
in front of her.   </p>

<p> Time was flying as the board exams neared. And soon it was Christmas
time.  Christmas preparations were in full swing in Kavita's
household. Kavita watched her siblings Sanjay and Vijay build a
Christmas crib.  </p>
                 
<p> "Christ was supposed to be born in a grass hut. How come our crib has
a roof made of tree branches? This is not authentic" said Kavita.  </p>

<p> "That is called artistic license" said Kavita's mother laughing. "This
hut is not made of grass but you are supposed to look at it and
imagine that it is made of grass."  </p>

<p> "One must have a little faith and that kind of thing" said Kavita.  </p>

<p> "It looks better when it is made of tree branches, I must say" said
 Vijay and Kavita nodded in agreement. </p>

<p> Sanjay cut more tree branches and he put it on the floor near the
crib. </p>

<p> "Can I do something?" asked Kavita. </p>

<p> "Well..." paused Sanjay thinking for a while. It was Christmas time and
he did not want to disappoint Kavita too much by saying she could not
help out. </p>

<p> "You can tie some of those twigs together. Then I will put it on the
roof. See, I will show you how to do it" said Sanjay.  </p>

<p> He took a little bundle and showed Kavita how to tie them together. </p>

<p> "Not this. I want to help in designing. Why can't I help in designing?
Vijay is helping you design and he is younger than me? Is it because I
am a female?" asked Kavita sulking. </p>

<p> "Well, you do this first. Then I will give you something else to do"
said Sanjay avoiding an argument. </p>

<p> Kavita was at the point of saying "Tie your stupid twigs yourself" when
her mother called out </p>

<p> "Kavita, Mole. Would you mind making some tea for Yasoda aunty?" </p>

<p>  Yasoda was their neighbor and was a mega bore. Everyone knew that
Yasoda was a bore. It was Kavita's mother's practice to leave
Kavita to entertain Yasoda every time she visited them. Her mother
would then disappear into the kitchen with the pretext of being busy.
Kavita decided tying stupid twigs was hundred times better than
chatting with Yasoda. </p>

<p>  "No, Ma. I am busy helping Sanjay and Vijay with making the crib"
said Kavita. She started tying the twigs together quickly and made
herself look really busy and important. </p>

<p>  "I will do it myself" said her mother from the kitchen. </p>

<p>  As time passed by, Sanjay allowed Kavita to paint squares on the
thermocol pieces that were supposed to be rock walls of the hut. He
allowed her to put some grass on the floor of the hut and hesitantly
agreed to carry out a few of Kavita's suggestions. It was clear that
Sanjay would have liked it a lot better if Kavita had no suggestions
of her own. Kavita could feel the mental stress she was inflicting on
her brother by asking him to do things when all he wanted her to do
was tie a few twigs together, or just watch his brilliant artistic
talents, or simply vanish from the spot till he had finished making
the crib. Kavita tried to keep quiet for she was in no mood to
complain. The crib was turning out to be a very pretty picture. </p>

<p>  "I called Raji over for Christmas. She is a new girl at my school. She
was asking whether we have a Christmas tree. I said no and she was very
surprised. She thought all Christians had Christmas trees in their houses
for Christmas" said Kavita to her mother. </p>

<p>  "Christmas trees are not part of our culture" said Kavita's mother. </p>

<p>  "I told her the same. Then she was asking whether we hung up socks for
Santaclaus. I said no and she was really surprised. She said all the
books she had ever read told her that people hung up socks for
Christmas. I am glad we at least have a crib as part of our
culture. Otherwise Raji will think we are not Christians at all" said
Kavita.  </p>

<p>  "Well, we are Malayalis. We have our own culture.  When she visits us
she will be introduced to a Malayali Christmas. It is unfortunate that
there is nothing about Malayali Christmas in any of your
books. Someone should write about it then people like Raji will not be
so shocked when they hear that there need not be a Christmas tree in a
Christian home for Christmas" Kavita's mother said.  </p>

<p>  True to her word, Raji arrived on Christmas morning in a very formal
attire.  She had a little present in her hand and a Christmas
card. She was very nervous and at a loss about how to behave. But as
soon as she saw that Kavita's mother was dressed in a sari, she became
more at ease. Kavita's mother looked a lot like her own mother.
Kavita's mother brought her a plate full of goodies to eat.  </p>

<p>  "What is this? Is this a cake? How come it does not have any icing?"
asked Raji.  </p>

<p>  "That is not a cake. It is an appam" said Kavita's mother. </p>

<p>  "That is a Mallu cake" said Vijay. </p>

<p>  "It is not a cake at all Raji. It is not baked. It is steamed in round
vessels.  It is more like big round sweet idlis than cakes" said
Kavita.  </p>

<p>  Kavita then took Raji to the kitchen and showed her how her mother
steamed the appams. </p>

<p>  "If you like more cake, you can have them. That is bought from the bakery.
For some reason Christmas is not complete without a cake for everyone.
But Christmas is not complete without these sweet appams for 
Mallus" explained  Kavita. </p>

<p> Raji was quite surprised with her Christmas visit to Kavita's
house. It was nothing like she had imagined. </p>

<p> "Mallu Christians are different from other Christians, I must say!"
she exclaimed as she left. </p>

<p> "Yes" said Kavita with a sigh. </p>

<p> After Raji left Kavita asked her mother </p>

<p> "Why are we so different from other people? We are not like most
Christians we see in the churches of Mumbai. The Goan Christians are
so different from us. They are more in sync with the picture of what
Christians are supposed to be than us. We are not like other people in
this building. Look at us. Our house is the only house celebrating a
festival at this time of the year. Everyone else celebrates Diwali and
then we are the only house that do not celebrate a festival. Why can't
we be like others? Why should we be so different?" </p>

<p> "Our culture is different, Mole" explained Kavita's mother a little taken
aback by Kavita's outburst. </p>

<p> "Why should our culture be different from others? Why should I belong
to an island culture? I want to be like everyone else. Why should I
be different from others?" asked Kavita.  </p>

<p> Kavita's mother gave her a hug and said  </p>

<p> "Kavita, one day you will learn that everyone is an island.
Sometimes people may seem like they are a group but look at them
carefully and you will see that everyone is alone. You come alone to
this world and you leave it alone. There is no point in trying to be
like everyone else. Learn to celebrate the special person in you."  </p>

<p> "I will" said Kavita. "Merry Christmas, Mother."   </p>

<p> It was traditional for Kavita's family to visit their eldest uncle
every Christmas. Kavita always looked forward to these visits.  </p>

<p> "It is a long time since I saw Beena" said Kavita. "Almost six
months. It will be fun to see her again."  </p>

<p> It was a long bus ride to Kavita's uncle's house. Kavita could see her
Uncle's building all the way from the bus stop. She could not wait to
see her cousins and she almost ran.  Her cousins were waiting for
Kavita's family in the balcony since early afternoon. They saw her
from far and they ran down to meet her halfway.  </p>

<p> "Beena" said Kavita happily. Her other cousins followed but Beena was
Kavita's favorite cousin. Other uncles and aunts had already arrived
and the house was really noisy. Beena had a lot to say about her
friends and her school.  </p>

<p> "Don't talk so much. It is not good for girls to talk so much" Beena's
mother would scold intermittently.  </p>

<p> But Kavita and Beena completely ignored all such complaints. They were
really happy to be with each other. Beena showed Kavita her new
photographs, her dresses, new books, interesting articles she had
read, or anything that had fancied her in the past six months. Time
passed quickly.  </p>

<p> "Come and have dinner" Beena's mother called from the visiting room. </p>

<p> Kavita and the other children went out to the visiting room. The dining
table was not big enough to seat all the cousins. So the youngsters sat
on the floor. The men sat at the table and the women served dinner. </p>

<p> "Want to have some beer Sanjay?" Kavita's elder uncle asked. </p>

<p> It was a Christmas tradition for all the men to drink beer or whiskey.
This invitation to drink beer was the sign that Sanjay was soon going to
be treated as an adult. </p>

<p> "No thank you" said Sanjay. </p>

<p> "Teenagers these days are turning out to be better than us. They don't
drink, they don't smoke. It is all a good sign" said another uncle
laughing. </p>

<p> "I do not know about other teenagers but my Sanjay sure is a nice boy"
said Kavita's mother very proudly. </p>

<p> "Some chicken curry for you?" Beena's mother asked Kavita. </p>

<p> "No aunty. I do not eat meat" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "Oh! I forgot that you do not eat meat. Now what will you eat with
your rice?  I am so sorry I forgot that you do not eat meat" said
Beena's mother. </p>

<p> "Is there anything vegetarian?" asked Kavita. </p>

<p> "I have some left overs from yesterday. But today is Christmas. You need
to eat well" said Beena's mother. </p>

<p> "Something is better than nothing" said Kavita with a grin. </p>

<p> "Look at that girl. There is chicken curry, mutton curry, pork curry,
and chicken biryani here today. And she has to eat leftovers for
Christmas!" said one of Kavita's uncle. </p>

<p> "One has to do what one has to do" said Kavita a little apologetic about
making the crowd around her feel sorry for her. </p>

<p> "This is not good. She is a Malayali girl. She will have problems with
her marriage if she does not eat meat. All this vegetarianism has to
stop" continued Kavita's uncle. </p>

<p> "What can we do? We have tried to force her to eat meat many times. She
simply will not listen" said Kavita's mother tragically. </p>

<p> "Make her eat meat. You are her parents. How come you cannot do that much?
Use some authority" continued the uncle. </p>

<p> "Authority does not work. She will fall sick" said Kavita's mother. </p>

<p> "Try some chicken curry, Mole. It is very good" said Beena's mother. </p>

<p> "No aunty. Please leave me alone. I am very happy with what I am
eating. Please do your own thing" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "People are saying this for your own good. You will face problems
in future with this attitude. All Malayali girls should eat meat.
Otherwise their husbands will be unhappy" said Beena's mother. </p>

<p> "Oh! gee! That is too bad. But I am sure I cannot eat meat" said Kavita
wanting to end the discussion. But it seemed like the debate would
continue a little longer. </p>

<p> "I need to get something from my bag" said Kavita and she disappeared
from the room. She stood outside the room till she made sure everyone was
talking about a completely different topic before she went back to the room. </p>

<p> "Every Christmas I have to go through this advise on giving up
vegetarianism. It is a pain" whispered Kavita to Beena. </p>

<p> "Do not mention it or else they will start again" said Beena giggling. </p>

<p> "Don't giggle when you are eating. Girls should not behave like that"
scolded Beena's mother. </p>

<p> "Giggling while eating will make Mallu husbands unhappy I bet" said Kavita
and the two girls giggled all the more. </p>
