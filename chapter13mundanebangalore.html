<h3> Chapter 13  </h3>
<h2>Domestic matters </h2> 

<p> Soon  Arti  was back  in  Bangalore.  Her  deal with  Mumbai
Research center allowed her to  work in Bangalore and find a
thesis adviser. This was easier said than done because there
was  no  one in  the  Bangalore  center  who worked  in  her
research area.  They gave her  a month's stipend to  make up
her mind.  Fortunately in Indian Science center  there was a
professor called Sharma who worked in her research area. But
this center did not have  much money. Things were formal and
Arti  had to  clear an  entrance exam  before she  could get
funding. The  entrance exam would occur only  the next year.
Arti started to work with  Sharma and decided to worry about
funding later. The Indian  Science center gave her an office
but no money. Arti was contend because the library was good.
Money never could be a deterrent to a scientist.</p>

<p> Thus Arti traveled to the Indian science center every day. Her home
in Bangalore was also taking some shape. One day she decided to buy
plants for her house. Arti stopped at a plant nursery on her way back
from the market. She was looking at the plants when a little man came
out of a hut. </p>

<p> "Looking for plants?" he asked. </p>

<p> "Just looking" said Arti. </p>

<p> "This plant is nice, look this plant is nice" said the man
and soon he took complete control. </p>

<p> "Well..." Arti began to say. But the man had already started
selecting plants for her. </p>

<p> "I know you are new here. You live in Samuel's house. I will
only get you the best plants possible" said the little man. </p>

<p> Soon he had kept aside ten little plants for her. </p>

<p> "I did not want so many plants, I just wanted one or two" said
Arti hesitantly. </p>

<p> "You don't like the plants I selected?" asked the man really
surprised. </p>

<p> Arti simply did not have the heart to say that she did not
like the plants. </p>

<p> "How much for the plants?" asked Arti. </p>

<p> "Twenty rupees" said the little man. </p>

<p> It was less than fifty cents and Arti was a little surprised at the
price. It took a little getting used to the price difference of things
in America and in India. She looked at the recycled little plastic
milk bags filled with mud and the small saplings in them. </p>

<p> "Thank you" she said paying him the money. She carried as many saplings
as she could in her hands.   </p>

<p> "I will come back for the rest soon" she said struggling with the load
in her hand. She opened the gate of her house and placed the saplings
in the backyard. She decided to go back and get the rest of the
plants.  To her surprise she found that the old man and his
grandchildren brought the rest of the plants for her. They had
followed her all the way home. </p>

<p> "Place them in the backyard. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much
for your help" said Arti. She was clearly overwhelmed with all this
help. But soon the old man brought all his garden tools and planted
the saplings in the little yard and he gave Arti a lot of advice about
how to care for the plants. </p>

<p> Arti took out a five rupee note and gave him but he refused to take
the money. It was clear that the old man cared a lot about the
saplings he planted in the little recycled plastic bags. </p>

<p> The old man started coming to her house regularly to check how his plants
were doing. Once in a while he would bring a plant along and say </p>

<p> "I bought you this plant. It is a special plant." </p>

<p> Arti suspected that these were times when he needed money. Arti did
not grudge him bringing her plants and always purchased all the plants
he brought. </p>

<p> Kabir found this scenario funny and he said  </p>

<p> "Hey! You are turning out to be a pseudo woman, Arti. You are behaving
like the pseuds. Mali (gardener), plant a rose here, mali water the
shrub there. Is it gardening by proxy or what?" </p>

<p> "Not my fault. The mali is here on his own" said Arti with a shrug. </p>

<p> Secretly Arti felt ridiculous with all the domestic help she had.  She
had a istriwala (a man who ironed clothes), a maid who swept and
mopped the floor everyday, a flower woman who bought flowers for her
hair everyday, a vegetable seller who knocked at her door everyday, a
milkman who delivered milk every morning, and a grocer who would bring
grocery home. It was different from America where she had to do
everything on her own. </p>

<p> "I am beginning to settle down in Bangalore" said Arti. </p>

<p> Arti also made quite a few friends in her neighborhood. Some were very
young and came to Arti for advice.  </p>

<p> "I am repeating myself so many times. I must write a book or
something" said Arti after she described the best way to cook
masoor dal to Tamanna, her immediate neighbor. </p>

<p> "Books there are plenty. But when you cook you always go by word of
mouth" said Tamanna.  </p>

<p> Tamanna had an arranged marriage. Her husband was a very angry person
always scolding her. Tamanna would finish up her cooking in the
morning and dress up and look pretty. She was much better looking than
her husband.  And instead of loving Tamanna for her beauty, her
husband hated her for it.  Tamanna came from a rich family. Her
husband was not rich but was very educated. Tamanna's parents married
her to this man because of his education. But Tamanna did not care
about his education. She did not like him. He was no fun to be
with. He was ill tempered. Tamanna brought out some clothes and placed
it on the bed for Arti to see. </p>

<p> "I will show you the things I bought from Shivaji Nagar" said Tamanna
with a chuckle. "I went yesterday to buy all this with Chitra. My
husband does not know I went." </p>

<p> "That is dangerous. What if he finds out that you go around the city
without telling him? You must not do that" said Arti. </p>

<p> "Oh! He will not know" said Tamanna. "I went in the morning and I came
back before seven. I left a note saying I am visiting Chitra. And I
went to Shivaji market."  </p>

<p>  Tamanna was obviously thrilled about fooling her husband. </p>

<p> "I left the child at the servant's place. I had fun shopping" said
Tamanna. </p>

<p> "It is a dangerous thing to do. You might get into trouble" said Arti
laughing. </p>

<p> "I had to sell my gold chain to buy all this. But it was worth it"
said Tamanna. </p>

<p> "You are selling all the jewelry your mother gave you for your wedding?
That is sad" said Arti. </p>

<p> "What can I do? I need money to spend" said Tamanna. </p>

<p> Arti was a little concerned about Tamanna. Her traditional family
would never approve of her not confirming to the role of a good
wife. Yet here rebellions were trivial compared to the life women all
over the world lived. She would go shopping without telling her
husband or maybe skip her daily prayers and lie about it. And it
thrilled her to do those little tricks and she would always tell Arti
about all her pranks. </p>

<p> "I am going to Ahmedabad next week. I will be back after a month. It
will be good to visit home" said Tamanna. </p>

<p> "Don't go shopping without telling anyone there" said Arti jokingly. </p>

<p> "I bet, I will. In fact I will do a lot of sight seeing on my own.
I have learned to do all these singleton trips in Bangalore. It is a
life skill and I am going to use it" said Tamanna. </p>

<p> "You will get into trouble" said Arti shaking her head. </p>

<p> But after a month Tamanna's husband came back alone from Ahmedabad. </p>

<p> "Where is Tamanna?" asked Arti. </p>

<p> "She is at home. She is with my family for sometime" said Tamanna's husband. </p>

<p> "Isn't she coming back to Bangalore?" asked Arti. </p>

<p> "She is learning some culture and discipline. She will be back after
sometime. Right now Bangalore is not the right place for her to be"
said Tamanna's husband. </p>

<p> "What do you mean?" asked Arti. </p>

<p> "Nothing. I just thought spending some time at home will make her
understand her culture better. She will be back soon" said Tamanna's
husband. </p>

<p> Tamanna came back after six months. She was a changed person. Her
voice was hardly audible. She spoke very softly and her spirit seemed
crushed.  Somehow Tamanna's husband liked the new Tamanna better. She
knew now that the husband was the boss. He liked the role of the
boss. But for Arti the spiritless Tamanna was a tragedy. Such people
did not make sense to Arti.  Arti had come back to India looking for
her past. But her past was gone forever. </p>

<p> "My world is shrinking" said Arti. "I know very few new people and
the old people I know are changing. Soon I will be a stranger in my
very own life.  An eternal visitor everywhere. And I came to India to
belong. I have become a nomad in the true sense.  All my life I never
felt I belonged anywhere. Now I know I will never belong anywhere.  I
feel like a stranger in my own home, with my friends, in my work
place, and even in my ambitions. I have this transient feeling of just
visiting. I wonder whether other people feel like that too." </p>

<p> "Feelings are  more universal than you think" said Kabir. </p>
