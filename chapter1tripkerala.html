<h3> Chapter 1  </h3>
<h2>A Kerala Vacation </h2>


<p> It was the final day of school before the final exams. The English
teacher did not come to school that day so Kavita's class had a free
period. Kavita and her friends were sitting on top of desks and
chatting. </p>

<p> "Gee! Madhavan just winked at me" said Kavita turning to her friends. </p>

<p> "What? That is an insult. You should go and slap him on the face" said
Pooja. </p>

<p> "Slap him?" gulped Kavita. Madhavan was a big boy and she could not
gather up nerves enough to go and slap him. </p>

<p> "Yes, you must slap him. He insulted you. We should all go and hit him" said
Pooja. </p>

<p> "That sounds like a good plan" said Kavita.  </p>

<p> Madhavan was not all that frightening if she had a group of friends
with her.</p>

<p> "Yes, let us go and hit him. Go ahead Kavita. Be tough. How dare he
insult us girls like this?" asked Pooja. </p>

<p>  All the girls agreed something had to be done. So Kavita went over to
 Madhavan and said </p>

<p> "Madhavan, you have insulted me. After school, you will learn a lesson
you will remember for the rest of your life." </p></p>

<p> "Oh, yeah?" asked Madhavan. </p>

<p> "Yes, you better watch out after class" said Kavita. </p>

<p> Kavita went back to her friends and said "We will deal with him
after school. I have asked him to meet us after school." </p>

<p> "We will beat the hell out of him" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "Yes" said Kavita a little uncertainly. Resorting to violence was not
to her taste. But if you must slap a boy, then you must. She had a
reputation to hold on to after all. </p>

<p> The final class of the day started and every one went back to their
seats.  All through the class, Madhavan had a group of girls darting
angry looks at him. He did not seem bothered by this show of
anger. Kavita was worried. She played with the idea of slapping
Madhavan and no matter how she looked at it, it was not a pleasant
task. When the class came to an end, she found herself really
scared. She waited for a couple of minutes and her friends gathered
around her. </p>

<p> "Let us take care of Madhavan now" said Pooja. "The idiot." </p> 

<p> Kavita decided to go into action. She gathered up all her courage.
But to her pleasant surprise Madhavan had sneaked away.  She was
relieved and she could not hide her grin. She was safe. </p>

<p> "Oh, the snake. He slipped away. He would have really been sorry he was
born, if he had dared to stay behind" said Kavita.  </p>

<p> "The rat. We will get him tomorrow" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "Tomorrow is a holiday. In fact the next three days there is no
school. We have study leave. That is a problem" said Kavita. </p>

<p> Kavita was secretly happy about it. </p>

<p> "He must have planned it so, the rat. But we must get him somehow" said
Pooja. </p>

<p> Just when Kavita began to relax again, Radha spotted Madhavan way down
the road. </p>

<p> "I see him on the road.  Let us go and get him" said Radha. </p>

<p> "Where? Where? Where is he?" asked Pooja. </p>

<p>  "There he is! See.  He is slowly walking with Rajan" said Radha. </p>

<p> "Let us get him" said Pooja. </p>

<p> The girls picked up their school bags and ran downstairs. Kavita was
not in such a hurry as Pooja was, but she ran all the same. Madhavan
turned back hearing the sounds of running feet. Seeing the girls he
jumped a fence and ran for his life. </p>

<p> "Oh! He escaped! Never mind we will get him. We will teach him to respect
women" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "Yes, we must" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "But there is no school for the next few days" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "I say let us forget this. We frightened Madhavan enough" said Kavita. </p>

<p> Kavita just wanted to forget about the whole incident. Madhavan was
too big a boy for her comfort and she did not want him to be her
permanent enemy. </p>

<p> "He should not get away this easily" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "He ran like a frightened rabbit" said Radha. </p>

<p> All the girls laughed. They walked back home talking and laughing
about how Madhavan would have reacted if they had slapped him.</p>

<p> When Kavita reached home, Kavita's mother said they were going on
a vacation to Kerala. Kavita was really happy. Trips to Kerala were
always fun.  She saw a bundle of clothes on the floor and her mother
was sewing away busily. </p>

<p> "Take the poha (rice flakes) and eat yourself Mole (daughter). I am a
little busy stitching clothes for your aunts. There are very few days
left before the trip. Your father is like that. Why can't he make up
his mind early?" asked her mother shaking her head. </p>

<p>  Kavita looked at all the suitcases her mother had piled up on the
floor.  Packing was going on in full swing. It was clear that her
mother looked forward to the trip to Kerala where Kavita's grand
parents lived. </p>

<p>  "Too much work. Very expensive these trips are" said her mother. </p>

<p>  The next few days the sound of the sewing machine was constantly heard. </p>

<p>  "Let me pedal the sewing machine for you for sometime. You will get
tired" said Kavita. And Kavita pedaled the machine for a few minutes. </p>

<p>  "No. No. You are going too fast. Go away, I do not have time" said
Kavita's mother chasing her away. </p>

<p> When the school exams were over, Kavita and her family boarded
the train to Kerala.  It took three days to reach Ernakulam from
Mumbai. The train was filled with Malayalis going home for
vacation. There were a lot of children and youngsters in the
compartment.  Soon everyone had made friends with each other. They
played cards and read books. </p>

<p> Kavita loved to climb up the little stairs and cozy up in the top
berth with a book. On the third day, early in the morning, she heard
her father say </p>

<p> "Kavita, wake up. Our station will be here soon." </p>

<p>  Kavita climbed down and looked out of the window. Lush green landscape
greeted her. This was Kerala. Beautiful green Kerala. After the dry
desert like scenery she had witnessed for two days, this was a blessed
vision. The coconut trees, the paddy farms, and the
little streams made a heady vision.  Kavita felt a strange excitement.
She would soon meet her extended family whom she rarely met. Every time
she went to Kerala, she met people whose role was limited to these
rare trips she made with her parents. Once she returned to Mumbai they
would vanish from her life. But today she was glad that they were
there waiting for her. </p>


<p>  When the train stopped at the station, a couple of coolies came and
picked up their luggage. </p>

<p>  "Keep a watch on the coolies, he may run off with our luggage" said Kavita's
mother. </p>

<p>  Kavita and her family had to run to keep pace with the coolies. Finally
they got to the bus stand. </p>

<p>  "We have two more bus rides before we reach home. We will be there
soon" said Kavita's father looking at the tired faces of the children. </p>

<p>  "Another couple of hours!" sighed Kavita. </p>

<p>   Kavita looked around her.  Most men wore white lungis. The women wore
saris which were not as good as the saris women in Mumbai wore. </p>

<p>  "How come they are not that well dressed?" asked Kavita. </p>

<p> "Rural People do not have fine clothes. They do not need fine
clothes" said her mother. </p>

<p> The shops were not as grand as the shops of Mumbai  nor did  Kerala
have double decker buses like Mumbai. </p>

<p> "It seems the people in Kerala are deprived of good things in life" </p>
said Kavita. </p>

<p> "Good things in life are not always sold in shops" said Kavita's father. </p>

<p> If Kavita felt that Kerala belonged to her parents and Mumbai belonged
to her she was not the only one. She clearly looked like an outsider.
She looked around her and saw a gaping group of simple village
folk. This made her snobbish and she decided to stare out of the
window for the rest of the bus journey. When the bus stopped, her
uncle and his family were there to greet them. They helped with the
luggage and soon she stood outside the gate of her grandfather's
house. The dog was barking loud and she saw a few chicken walking
around in the yard. A tall coconut tree stood in the middle of the
yard. It was the same tree that she feared as a child.  She was scared
to play under it for she feared that the coconuts would fall on her
head. The place had a certain timelessness about it. </p>

<p> Her grandmother was there waiting for her. As soon as she saw them she
began to cry. </p>

<p> "You people have forgotten me. How come you did not come earlier?"  she
asked. </p>

<p> "We are here now. Do not cry" said Kavita's father. </p>

<p> "You must not forget your old mother like that" she complained. </p>

<p> She cried for sometime and hugged everybody. She showed Kavita's
family to their rooms and then she served an elaborate lunch. The
house was huge but the furnishings were not as elegant as in Mumbai
houses.  Only close family entered the house.  Casual visitors were
met in the long corridor outside. Many rooms were used for storing
grains and fruits hung from the ceilings. </p>

<p> "I cannot believe you have a whole room to just store grains" said Kavita
in awe. </p>

<p> "It is not like Mumbai, Mole. Houses are big here" said Kavita's
grandmother. </p>
 
<p> Kavita's grandmother went to the kitchen to supervise the preparations
of the evening meals. Kavita followed her to the kitchen. Most meals
were cooked on firewood. The smell of burning wood in the early hours
of the evening was very pleasant. The dishes were washed in the
backyard and water came from a well unlike taps of Mumbai.  </p>

<p> "Let us make curry of two chickens today. My child from Mumbai must
not have eaten good village chicken curry in years" said the
grandmother. </p>

<p> Soon Kavita saw a little servant kill a chicken. It was no gross
looking butcher with a big knife killing a chicken but a ten year old
servant with a grin on his face. The scene shocked Kavita. But when
the servant tried to kill another chicken, he failed miserably.  Every
time the servant got near a chicken, Kavita chased it away. Kavita's
mother scolded her but Kavita could not bear the thought of the
chicken being killed. She defied her mother and made sure that no
other chicken was killed that evening. After that day all chicken were
killed in the house when Kavita was not around. </p>

<p>  Kavita's maternal grandfather had also come to meet them the very
first day they reached Kerala. Formally he had come to take Kavita's
mother to his home. But decorum would not allow Kavita's mother to
leave with her father the very next day. Moreover decorum would not
allow Kavita's grandfather to be a guest for more than one day in this
house. It just did not seem right for him to go back alone. So Kavita
was asked to go with her grandfather.  This deal seemed to satisfy her
grandfather. Kavita packed a little bag and followed her grandfather
to her mother's ancestral house. Her grandfather spoke little. He was
a grand old man nearing a hundred years but he did not look too
old. He walked straight and he used his umbrella like a walking stick. </p>

<p>  "Do you carry that umbrella all the time? Even when it is not
raining?" asked Kavita. </p>

<p>  "It is useful when it is very sunny and hot" said her grandfather
 smiling.  Kavita liked the toothless smile of her grandfather. </p>

<p>  They got into a bus and a lot of people seem to know her
grandfather.  </p>

<p>  "Did your daughter arrive from Mumbai?" someone asked. </p>

<p>  "Yes, she did. This is my daughter's child. I am taking her home" he said. </p>

<p> Kavita was in awe of her grandfather. He seemed so wise and calm.  She
did not chatter too much as was her habit. She tried to imitate him.
She sat straight like him, held her head high, and looked around from
time to time.  When they finally got to their destination all the
people they met on the road asked </p>

<p> "So did your daughter come from Mumbai? Where is she?"   </p>

<p> "Yes, but she will come home later. This is my grandchild. She came
with me."  </p>

<p> Kavita's grandfather replied again and again. </p>

<p> "How come everyone knows we are visiting from Mumbai?" asked Kavita. </p>

<p> "This is a small world, Mole. Everyone knows everyone else. It is not like
Mumbai" Kavita's grandfather explained. </p>

<p> Kavita followed her grandfather as he walked towards his house. The path
to her grandfather's house was very beautiful. They had to walk on little
mounds that separated paddy fields and many times Kavita slipped and
stepped into the watery ground and her shoes got dirty. </p>

<p> "Careful" said her grandfather. "Look where you are going."  </p>

<p> But it was hard for Kavita to keep her eyes on the ground. The pretty
coconut trees and the exotic wild birds all around thrilled
Kavita. There were many ponds filled with lotus flowers in full bloom.
Kavita had drawn lotuses in her drawing classes a hundred times but
she had seen a real flower only a few times in Mumbai. That too sold
as buds in baskets in the markets. But here it was all
different. Nature seemed wanton in her beauty. Pretty things existed
everywhere. </p>

<p> "Kerala is like a big garden" said Kavita and her grandfather laughed. </p>

<p> There were streams on the path. They had to take off their shoes and
walk bare feet to cross the streams. Kavita stopped to watch the
little fish in the water. This was tropical India at its best. Life
existed in its varied splendor. It was like a place one saw only in
dreams. Even the old man walking in front of her, her grandfather
somehow did not seem real. He was so different from the people she
knew back in Mumbai. </p>

<p> "It is really so much fun to be in Kerala" said Kavita and as
usual Kavita's grandfather only smiled. </p>

<p> If Kavita's grandfather was reserved in his manner, it was all
different when they reached home. There was a little crowd gathered to
meet them. Their welcome was very warm and better than any welcome she
had in her life. It made Kavita guilty that she did not visit
Kerala more often. </p>

<p>  "Kavita came with me. The others will only be here next week" her
 grandfather announced.  </p>

<p> He then went in to the corridor and kept his umbrella in place. He
 pulled a chair and sat down in his favorite spot. There he sat all
 the time talking very little but always busy making something. His
 half finished basket was on the floor. A half finished fishing net
 was hanging from the ceiling near his chair. There were a few farm
 tools which were on the process of mending. He soon started working
 on the fishing net and looked from time to time at all the excitement
 that Kavita's visit had brought along. </p>

<p> All her little cousins and aunties gathered around her. They had
collected all sorts of exotic fruits for her. Some of the fruits she
had never seen in her life. </p>

<p> "These are really seasonal. We saved these for you" her cousin brother said. </p>

<p> Kavita's uncle, who was only a couple of years older than her, showed
her a honey bees nest and said "We are waiting for it to grow. When it
becomes a little bigger we will extract honey from the nest." </p>

<p> "Will I be able to see you do that?" asked Kavita. </p>

<p> "No, You are going back too soon" said Kavita's uncle. </p> 
 
<p> "Let us steal some eggs"  he added seeing Kavita's disappointed face. </p>

<p> They went looking around the farm house and collected a few eggs.  He
then made a little fire with sticks and boiled the eggs and offered it
to Kavita. </p>
 
<p> "These are the best boiled eggs I have eaten in my life" said Kavita
grinning. </p>

<p> "Stolen eggs taste better than usual" said Kavita's uncle. </p>

<p> In Mumbai most of Kavita's aunts and uncles were grown up. Here they
were teenagers like herself.  The next day Kavita went with her aunts
to school.  Mumbai schools would not allow guests. But in villages
guests were a rare sight. Moreover every one knew Kavita's family in
the village including the teachers.  The entire school came to meet
her. </p>

<p> "How is your brother doing?" the class teacher asked. </p>

<p> "He is fine" Kavita said. </p>

<p> Kavita's aunt whispered to her "The last time your brother was here,
we took him to school. He answered all the math questions and so the
teacher is very impressed with him." </p>

<p> "Oh, Gee! Now she will ask me math questions and I will not know a thing.
She will think I am a dud."  </p>

<p> "Oh, no! She wont ask you anything. Don't worry."  </p>

<p> But Kavita was scared that a stray question will soon be directed to her
and she hoped that the school would end soon. </p>

 <p> The corridor played an important role in Kavita's maternal home. Even
the main dining room was at the end of the long corridor.  Women and
children however never sat at the table in the dining room but ate in
the kitchen on the floor. If there were no guests Kavita's grandfather
sat alone at the end of a huge dining table to eat. Kavita's
grandmother  brought food for him from the kitchen and stood at
the door till he finished eating.  It amused everyone when Kavita said
she wanted to eat dinner at the table with her grandfather. </p>

 <p> "These girls from Mumbai. They are not shy at all" laughed Kavita's
grandmother shaking her head. </p>

 <p> "Behaving like men!" said an aunt.  </p>

 <p> But it was all taken in good spirit.  Her grandfather was a little
amused too. He was certainly very fond of Kavita. Moreover this was
not a rule he made. He never asked the women not to eat at the
table. This was the way things were everywhere and he did not care
about changing anything. Now if his granddaughter wanted to sit at the
table with him, he was not going to make a fuss about rules. </p>

 <p> Kavita watched her grandfather eat and she imitated him. He drank
sweet coconut liquor from a tall glass along with his meal. Kavita
poured some liquor for herself in a glass and drank it. This created a
lot of mirth for everyone surrounding the two diners. Kavita's
grandfather did not say anything but the women laughed a lot. Soon
Kavita's mother who was in the kitchen heard of her adventure. </p>

 <p> "What are you doing? You will get sick" Kavita's mother said. </p> 

 <p> "No, this liquor tastes really good" said Kavita.  </p> 

 <p> "Father! How could you stand and watch Kavita drink?" scolded Kavita's
mother. "Have you no sense? Father, why don't you say something?" </p> 

 <p> "A little coconut toddy can never hurt anyone" said Kavita's grandfather. </p> 

 <p> But when Kavita got up after dinner, she felt rather giddy. She swooned
after taking a few drunken steps. She woke up next morning and all that
she could remember was a lot of people laughing at her. </p> 

<p> Kavita remained awed by her grandfather though she did not attempt
drinking his coconut toddy again. He belonged to an era when a man
knew everything. He could build houses and his own house was mostly
built by him slowly. He could farm. He knew all about Ayurvedic
medicine and he could make all the farm tools. He appeared very wise
compared to her own father who depended on so many people to do the
most basic things. Her grandfather would survive in a jungle.  </p> 

<p> Soon the vacation was coming to an end. Kavita had to return to
Mumbai.  She did not know when she could come back. The question that
faced both Kavita and her older relatives was whether they would still
be alive when she came back. She turned around and saw her grandfather
wipe his tears. Kavita could tell that he had tried to fight back
those tears with all his might. It did not go with his image of an
iron man. </p> 

<p> "Father, Are you crying? I never thought you could cry!" Kavita's
mother exclaimed. Everyone else reacted similarly and soon Kavita's
grandfather gave his usual toothless smile. </p> 

<p> The journey back to Mumbai was drab. Kavita's heart felt heavy. The
faces of the people she left behind kept coming back to her mind. Her
aunts had followed them to the bus stop which was as far as they could
go on foot. Some of her uncles had followed them to the railway
station. All night relatives had filled sacks with food specific to
Kerala for them to carry back to Mumbai. </p> 

<p>  "Enough, enough" Kavita's mother cried time and again. </p> 

<p>  "When will I be able to give you all something? When will I see you again?
 Please take this with you" someone would say. </p> 

<p> There had been a lot of weeping. It was a very sentimental village
 indeed. Even casual neighbors would shed a tear or two when visitors
 left. Going to Kerala was expensive and such trips were rare for
 Kavita's family. She was leaving behind a world she did not know when
 she will return to. She surely did want to return again and again to
 this wonderful place and people. </p>
