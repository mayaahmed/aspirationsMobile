<h3> Chapter 9  </h3>
<h2>The Career of Dreams</h2>

<p> College was a different place from school. It was a new place and all
at once Kavita was meeting a whole new world. It had been exciting
when a new student would join school, then Kavita would make a new
friend and this new student would tell her of a world Kavita had not
seen.  Kavita always had liked new students joining her school but
these were rare events at her school. Once every couple of years some
new student had turned up. Some she liked and some she did not. But the
numbers were so small that it not matter. </p>

<p> Kavita was not prepared for college where she had to make acquaintances
at a pace she did not like. Also the crowd was a very competitive lot
and everyone was fighting for space. It was the science stream and
only the best got admissions to her college. Almost everyone had been
top students at their respective schools and here they were just one
among the faceless crowd. Everyone had an image of being a bright
student in their surroundings and Kavita wondered why she was where
she was in the first place. No one had particularly thought of Kavita
as being intelligent or even that she amounted to anything. Even she
did not think that she amounted to anything. And every time she was
dragged into a show of might fight, she was at a loss about what to
do. But it secretly pleased her that her fellow students were
competing with her. That raised her opinions about herself.  </p>

<p> Kavita was lucky to have Pooja with her. They gave each other support and
also faced and defeated an opponent by virtue of being two people against
one. And slowly they had settled down even forming friendships along the
way. Though some people remained till the very end finding space, Kavita
and Pooja had found comfortable spots for themselves in the new surroundings.
Meena was one such friend. She had got a score of almost hundred percent
in the board exams and to everyone she had met in the early days of college,
she had not failed to mention her score.  </p>

<p>  "How much percentage of marks did you get in your board exam?" Meena
would ask.  </p>

<p>  "Eighty eight" the poor victim would say proudly.  </p>

<p>  "Eighty eight? I got a ninety nine point seven percent" 
Meena would say.  </p>

<p> The poor victim would have no choice but be impressed and also feel a
little bad about her own eighty eight percent. But soon the tests came
along and Meena was getting zeros just like everybody else. These
tests were the great equalizers. Meena soon adjusted to scoring zeros
and respecting her fellow students for their low scores of one or two
out of a hundred. Kavita was a little shocked by the zeros she was
scoring but she took comfort in the fact that people like Meena were
also getting zeros. But soon Kavita's scores improved dramatically
compared to the rest of the students in the class to her own surprise.
She sat down to analyze this phenomena. </p>

<p> "I guess confusion is not a new concept to me. To the other students
in the class, who are traditionally bright, confusion or not understanding
something takes a bit of getting used to. Some of them are in a state of
real shock after the initial zeros. Maybe, for me adjusting to a confused
state is easy. There is no other way I can explain why I am doing so
well compared to others who are far better than me" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "Adjusting to confusion? You are never out of the confused state,
Kavita" said Pooja. Pooja was doing quite well too.  Pooja was not in
general a confused person. But Pooja was turning in to a very
responsible person and her goals were more focused. And there was
another board exam around the corner. </p>

<p>  "Two board exams in a gap of two years takes a toll on anyone" said Kavita. </p>

<p>  "These life defining exams are a farce. There is something wrong about
the entire process" said Pooja. </p>

<p>  In general, the attitude of students towards teachers had changed in
college.  Teachers were now a respectable group of human beings.  The
college teachers seemed more learned and had an air of importance
about them. Also since the teachers were new there was an element of
surprise in their presentations.  Among them Krishnan was a teacher
who was a master at surprises. </p>

<p>  "Everybody stand up" Krishnan  would say at the beginning of the
class. </p> 

<p>  Kavita had stood up every class when she was in school and shouted a
"Good morning teacher" or a "Good afternoon teacher" as the case may
be, with the other students. It was a rather drawled out "Good morning
teacher" shouted out in a sing song voice. Kavita was glad that they
were done with that practice in college. But Krishnan was the only
teacher who made it a point to have students stand up for a minute
before and after class. He did not insist on singing the "Good morning
teacher" to him.  And Kavita was grateful to him for that.</p>

<p>  "What is sine 2x?"  Krishnan  would suddenly ask a student dreaming
away in the last benches.</p>

<p>  The poor student after being disturbed from his reverie would be at a
loss to what sine 2x was.</p>

<p>  "Find out what sine 2x is and write the formula down a hundred times.
Or wait a minute what is your role number?" Krishnan would ask.</p>

<p>  "258" the student would say.</p>

<p>  "Yes. Write it down 258 times" Krishnan  would order.</p>

<p>  In general, the students were scared of Krishnan and he was even
nicknamed "Dictator".  Krishnan would go into  tirades of how
trigonometry was his first love and Algebra was his second.  Kavita
had never before heard anyone speak of love for mathematics and she
could not help wondering what his wife's number was. One day, Krishnan
decided that it was high time the students talked about their love for
mathematics too.</p>

<p>  "Everyday from now on, we will have some student come up here and talk
about how he or she loves mathematics" announced Krishnan.

<p> Kavita looked around wondering whether there really existed such people in
her class.</p>

<p> "Who wants to talk first? We need volunteers" said Krishnan.</p>

<p> After a little hesitance Mira volunteered to speak.</p>

<p> "You love mathematics?" asked Kavita.</p>

<p> "I can say something for two minutes. I might learn to love mathematics
in the process. If not, at least Krishnan  will look kinder upon me
if I don't remember what sine 2x is" said Mira.</p>

<p> The next day Mira gave a neat speech of how she had loved mathematics
from the time she was three years old and how mathematics was a
fascinating subject.</p>

<p> "Nice speech Mira. Mathematics truly is wonderful"  said Krishnan.
He soon had a list of speakers for the next couple of weeks and every
day a student was professing his love for mathematics for two minutes.</p>

<p> But now there was a boy called Ramesh in the class who was very good
at mathematics.  In fact he was quite popular with the girls in the
class. Many a times some girl would go to him with some math problem
to chat him up. And one day Ramesh decided to volunteer to talk about
his love for mathematics.</p>

<p> "Mathematics is truly a wonderful and fascinating subject" said
Ramesh.</p>

<p> Krishnan nodded vehemently in agreement. Ramesh continued</p>

<p> "But how are we teaching mathematics nowadays? Are the teachers who claim
to love mathematics making sure that the students also love mathematics?
Or are they satisfied with the two minute speeches that anybody can give?"</p>

<p> Krishnan now knew that this speech was getting rather personal and he
began to look at his wrist watch.  He tried to smile when Ramesh
started criticizing his method of making students write a formula two
hundred times.</p>

<p> "What is the point of writing a formula two hundred times? Will that make
anyone love mathematics?" asked Ramesh. </p>

<p>  Krishnan had no answer to give but the whole class was in awe.
Ramesh did not stop at just criticizing the math teaching he went on
and asked</p>

<p> "Why must we stand in mock respect? True respect should come from the heart.
Is it proper to demand respect?"</p>

<p> Ramesh went on to ask many such questions. Krishnan was happy when the
two minutes were up. He skipped saying how good the speech was and
announced</p>

<p> "We were lucky to have some wonderful speakers. But I regret to say that
because of the lack of time we can not have anymore speeches after today.
We need to concentrate more on beautiful mathematics."</p>

<p> Needless to say Ramesh became more popular than ever and there were
now three girls competing for his affections. Kavita and Pooja placed
their bets on who will get Ramesh in the end.</p>

<p> Though the competition for Ramesh's affections tickled Kavita's sense
of humor, intelligence, suddenly had become a charming quality to
Kavita too. She had not particularly found any academically inclined
boy interesting before. But now she stood in awe of scientists because
she aspired to be one herself. Kavita found it intriguing that most of
her college teachers loved their subjects.</p>

<p>  "Do not be in a hurry. Make sure the proportions are right before mixing
the chemicals" said Radha the chemistry lab instructor.</p>

<p> "What difference can it make? A little less a little more. What is the
big fuss about?" asked Kavita.</p>

<p> "Chemistry is an exact science" said Radha. "If you want to make
 sodium chloride in the lab, then the process has to be just
 right. That is the charm of chemistry. Science is like painting. It
 is like art. We are more exacting and we aim for eternity. In that
 sense, we are more rigorous than art. But there is immense beauty all
 the same."</p>

<p> Kavita had only begun to appreciate scientists but not science
 yet. Science for her was a series of exams and in no way
 interesting. Perhaps, in time, she would understand what Radha was
 saying.</p>

<p> Kavita got back to intense studying. She began to wonder what it would
be like if she became a famous scientist. Scientists lived in books
and the ones she knew by name were all dead. They did not have an
adoring crowd of fans like cricketers or movie stars. But may be she
will be a different kind of scientist. She pictured herself signing
autographs and she smiled. She was disturbed from her reverie by music
coming from the living room and Kavita realized that it was Chaya geet
time on the television.  Chaya geet was a program that was aired
every Thursday night and was very popular. That evening for some
reason, all the songs played on Chaya geet were sad songs.  The theme
of the songs was about how the days that pass never come back.</p>

<p> "Why do people write these sad songs? The words of these sad songs are
 so beautiful. Why is sorrow so fascinating?  If misery was such a bad
 thing then why does it sound so beautiful?"  asked Kavita.</p>

<p> "It is a poets job" said Kavita's father. "He takes all sorts of
feelings and presents it in beautiful words. It is true that the days
that pass will never come again.  A poet can make this fact sound sad
with his play of words. But life's beauty lies in the anticipation of
the days to come and the innumerable experiences the future will
bring" said Kavita's dad.</p>

<p> "Anticipation of the days to come? Never heard a sad song on that subject
yet" said Kavita.</p>

<p> "The future is a little frightening, a little exciting, but thank
goodness, not a sad concept" said Kavita's father.</p>

<p> However the immediate future for Kavita was not accurately predicted
by her father. Kavita went for her college social. It was her first
social and she did not like the environment much. There was a lot of
smoke in the air and there was a stench of alcohol. Her eyes were
stinging. Loud music was playing and people were dancing on the floor.
Kavita decided it was no place for her and was about to leave when she
saw Amar singing on stage with mike in his hand.</p>

<p> "Amar is more versatile than we thought. He can sing too" said
Pooja.</p>

<p> He was actually  dancing too. A couple of girls had joined him and
he was having a whale of a time. When he saw Kavita in the audience he
sang a little louder.</p>

<p> When the singing was over Kavita stepped out into the street. She had
mixed emotions. She knew she did not like Amar dancing and singing
with other girls. But then she hardly knew Amar. She felt hurt.</p>

<p>"Serves me right for getting in to all this mess in the first place"
said Kavita to herself. </p>


<p> When Pooja met Kavita again she asked</p>

<p> "Why did you leave? There were plenty of songs after you left." </p>

<p> "One song is a good indication of what the other songs would be like. Also
I had a few other things to do" said Kavita.</p>

<p> "That means you are going to waste a lot more time now thinking about
Amar's singing" said Pooja.</p>

<p> "On the contrary, it seems like I will be saving a lot more time from
 now on" said Kavita. "No more castles in the air for me."</p>

<p> "Only silly people built castles in the air" said
Pooja.</p>

<p> "Castles in the air by their very nature are supposed to be based on
very little. And what a castle it was!" said Kavita dreamily.</p>

<p> There was not much time for young girls to build castles or mend
broken hearts. Life was in a hurry.  Kavita's final exams were
over. It was now a series of entrance exams.  The uncertain future was
always on her mind. Many a times Kavita fantasized about how good it
would be if she had aced all the entrance exams she wrote. All her day
dreams now consisted of the postman bringing her tidings of passing
one exam or the other. Her dreams even had a preference list and she
chose one exam results to the other.  Reality on the other hand was
gruesome and nerve shattering. She faced her failures with a fortitude
she had not expected in herself.</p>

<p> Kavita had traveled to  many parts of the country for giving entrance
exams.  She wrote all kinds of entrance exams.  She wrote exams to
become a medical doctor, engineer, and even an architect. This medley
appeared funny to her but that was what all her friends were doing. A
crowd of lost souls surrounded her and no one appeared too smug. The
ones who had passed an exam or two were clearly ecstatic but it was
more like a joy of a person who escaped execution than the joy of
achievement.  </p>


<p> "The silver lining in the cloud is that I am seeing the country"
Kavita told Pooja.  Pooja was among the lucky ones and she was
traveling to Delhi to become a doctor.</p>

<p> "The clouds have to pour one day. It will be passe soon" said Pooja
sympathetically.</p>

<p> "Yes. My struggles of finding my spot under the sun is not over yet"
said Kavita.</p>

<p> Finally good news came Kavita's way. She got a  letter of admission to a
Medical college in Cochin. She read the letter and told her mother</p>

<p> "In the journey of life there are no dead ends. I am going to be a
doctor. I have to go to Cochin to pursue my studies." </p>

<p> "With hard work you can win the world" said Kavita's mother. "Hard
work and determination are the keys to success."</p>

<p> "Yes" said Kavita. "I can shape my life with my determination and hard
work."</p>

<p> And soon Kavita was on a train journey to Kerala again but this time
she was going alone.  Her family and friends were left behind in
Mumbai. She soon settled down in the train and looked around
her. There were a few strangers vying for her attention and she was
reminded of Amar. She smiled to herself. Amar's memory always made her
smile. The role of Amar remained uncertain in her life. But that again
was the concept of Maya which said that life was an illusion. It did
not matter.</p>
