<h3> Chapter 8  </h3>
<h2>A Trip to Nagpur</h2>


<p> Even though the exams were over Kavita had to wait for her results. It
was summer vacation and Kavita found herself with plenty of time in
her hands.  But she could not have fun. Every time she was really happy
doing something, a nagging doubt would surface that her exam results
would turn out pathetic. So, she tried to stay as placid as possible
to avoid any bad luck.</p>

<p> "Let us go to Nagpur and visit Manisha. It should be a change of scene
and also help kill time till the results are out" said Pooja one day. </p>

<p> "Let us do that" said Kavita. </p>

<p> The two girls packed their bags and set out in a bus to Nagpur.  The
bus to Nagpur in its very appearance set itself apart from Mumbai
buses. It looked more uncomfortable than the local buses and the crowd
around Pooja and Kavita were a rustic lot.</p>

<p> "Where do these people come from? It seems that suddenly from
nowhere all these Nagpur people have turned up at this bus stop.
I wonder where they were hiding in Mumbai all this time?" asked
Pooja. </p>

<p> "I do not know. There are many things around you that you do not
see. Your mind takes only a small portion of the information around
you at any given time. Since we are taking a bus to Nagpur this group
of people have become important to us and we see them. If we were not
going to Nagpur we would have walked by this very bus stop and may not
have seen this crowd of people.  We may walk down a street a hundred
times but we will know of a shop in that street only if we want to buy
something from it.  There may be a thousand shops we see everyday and
yet do not see" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "See and yet do not see. That is a deep one" said Pooja. </p>

<p> The conductor after selling tickets to everyone went and sat in a seat
that was reserved for conductors. Kavita decided to save the bus
tickets as a souvenir. After a few hours the bus stopped at a little
restaurant for lunch. Everyone got down from the bus and went to the
restaurant. The restaurant sold tea, batatawadas, kachoris and a few
odd things. Kavita and Pooja decided to try the batatawadas for lunch
since the lunch thalis did not look very appealing to them. They also
bought some tea because they were tired but it was undrinkable. They
decided to throw it away. Kavita noticed that most women did not like
the tea but the men in the group did not mind the tea at all. Some of
them were drinking more than one cup. </p>

<p> "I guess men are used to bad tea more than women. They have more
practice at drinking bad tea outside their homes everyday" said
Kavita. </p>

<p>  "Bad tea is one thing I cannot stomach. I don't know how
these people are drinking that stuff" said Pooja. </p>

<p>  The bus continued stopping every few hours at some restaurant or other
where the men refilled themselves with tea to the utter horror of the
two girls. Moreover all the restaurants looked the same and sold the
same things. The restaurants were furnished with wooden benches and
the plates and glasses were made of aluminum or some such metal. </p>

<p>  Kavita and Pooja had batatawada for dinner and breakfast the next day
for there was nothing else available that they could eat.  The
batatawadas were good but they had one too many and by the time they
reached Nagpur they never wanted to see another batatawada in their
life. Manisha and her father were waiting for them at the bus stop. </p>

<p>  "Girls, did you eat lunch? Do you want to drink some tea? The
batatawadas in that shop are supposed to be really good" said Manisha's
father very concerned. </p>

<p>  "We are fine. Let us go home" said Kavita. </p>

<p>  "You must at least drink some tea. You two must be tired after the
journey" said Manisha's father. </p>

<p>  "Tea! No!" said Kavita, Pooja, and not surprisingly Manisha too.
Manisha's father was a little surprised at this outburst from the
women and the poor man  decided to have a cup of tea all by
himself. </p>


<p> Nagpur was really hot in summer. The roofs of the buildings were
covered with grass mats which was continuously kept wet to cool the
building. Kavita had never seen that kind of air conditioning system.
Kavita enjoyed pouring buckets of water on the floor and watch it
evaporate within minutes. </p>

<p> "There is not much to see around here like Mumbai. Let us go to a
park nearby" said Manisha apologetically. </p>

<p> The three girls set out to go to the park. </p>

<p> "Let us take a rickshaw. It is kind of hot and the park is a
 little far" said Manisha. </p>

<p> "Sounds like a nice plan" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "Rickshaw"  called out Manisha.</p>

<p> An old man came up pulling a cart behind him. This was a human
rickshaw. Kavita had never seen a human rickshaw before. It seemed
a cruel concept.</p>

<p>"Where do you want to go?" asked the old man.</p>

<p> "Baba Amte gardens" said Manisha.</p>

<p> "I cannot go in that rickshaw. It is inhuman" said Kavita.</p>

<p> "This man needs a job. You are only doing him a favor by
going in his rickshaw. Would you like to see him beg?" asked
Manisha. They were talking in English but the old man understood
what Kavita's concern was.</p>

<p> "Lots of strength in these arms, beti. Don't worry" he said
with a toothless grin.</p>

<p> The three girls sat in the cart and the man began to run pulling the
rickshaw behind him. Kavita watched the man closely and saw that he
was disfigured and slowly realized that he was a leper. She had never
seen any lepers work before. All the lepers she met on the Mumbai
streets were beggars.</p>

<p> "Baba Amte build these hospitals for lepers in Nagpur. They are
working on treating the disease. People from all over the country come
here. They work as rickshaw pullers to make some money" explained
Manisha.</p>

<p> Kavita was happy to give the old man his fees. In the hot sun he had
pulled the rickshaw and it was inhuman but it was far better than the
alternative he faced. The pride with which he took the money from Kavita
remained sketched in her memory for a long time.</p>

<p> "Baba Amte lives in Nagpur? I would like to see him" said Kavita.</p>

<p> "He visits often. But he is always traveling. Hard to meet
him" said Manisha.</p>

<p> "It is amazing that one man can make such a difference to the world.
He has completely changed the world for these diseased people. This is
a lesson I will remember whenever I wish that things were different
with the world. If you want it to be different then you must bring the
change. And it does not matter even if you are alone. Baba Amte has
shown that one person can change the world if he chooses to" said
Kavita.</p>

<p> "But is it really better? Being human rickshaws are not so much
better than being beggars" said Pooja.</p>

<p> "May be not a lot better but definitely better. And if you want it to
be even better then you must make the change" said Manisha laughing.</p>

<p> "This makes me wonder about the limits to human abilities. How far can
we go? Are all limitations unreal? Are there no boundaries?" asked
Pooja.</p>

<p> "May be there are no boundaries. And anything we
want is possible.  But all of us are afraid
of dreams. We like to set boundaries" said Kavita. </p>

<p> When they got back from the gardens it was late evening. The roads
were busy with the human rickshaws flying to and fro. But now they
ceased to be symbols of human degradation for Kavita. The rickshaws
represented preservation of human dignity under dire circumstances.
The few days Kavita spend in Nagpur went fast because of the heat.
The weather was intolerable and the days were spend trying to keep
cool.  Kavita required no entertainment because the climate of Nagpur
was a great surprise and experiencing it was novel. </p>

<p> Kavita and Pooja were happy when they got back to Mumbai. </p>

<p> "May lightning strike me if I ever complain about the weather in
Mumbai. This is paradise" said Kavita and Pooja agreed.  </p>

<p> When Kavita returned from her trip her dog Sonya did not run
up to her to greet her as usual.</p>

<p> "Where is Sonya?" Kavita asked her mother.</p>

<p> "Sonya is no more. She swallowed a bone and we could do nothing.  We
took her to the vet. But we could not save her. Anyways it is better
that she is dead. She was old and she could not eat anything.  It must
have been very painful before her death" Kavita's mother explained.</p>

<p> "Why is it better that she is dead? How can anything be better because
Sonya is no more? Why did she have to die?"  asked Kavita with tears
flooding her eyes.</p>

<p> "Everything in this world has to die. That is the way of nature"
explained her mother.</p>

<p> "This is terrible. Now I will be afraid of liking anything else in the
world.  Death will snatch it away from me" said Kavita.</p>

<p> "One does not stop liking things because they die. It is a pleasant
experience to like something and you have sweet memories. These
memories make your life worthwhile and will fill your winter years
much later in life" said her mother.</p>

<p>"Every memory of Sonya comes with the thought that she is no more.
It was pleasant when she lived. Always pleasant. Her memories after
her death brings me only pain" said Kavita.</p>

<p>"But you knew that she would not live long. It should be no surprise"
her mother said.</p>

<p> "The surprise is in the fact that I cannot deal with the fact of
temporary happiness. That I have something nice but only for this
short period of time. Then I have to live with memories. Memories
serve no purpose. One could always have dreamed of a past which never
existed. What does it matter whether something existed or not in the
past?  What is there now is all that matters" said Kavita.</p>

<p>"By your logic then it should not matter whether Sonya existed or not.
Then isn't it better that Sonya existed?" asked her mother.</p>

<p> "It is hard to tell when your reason is clouded with emotions" said
Kavita. "If misery is other people, then happiness is other people
too.  So Sonya's beautiful story now lies sealed in my heart with the
scar called death. And thus many a scar my eyes will see, before I
leave a scar of my own for others." </p>

<p> Finally the board exam results were out. Kavita and Pooja reached
school as soon as they heard that the results were announced. The
results were displayed on a notice board. Many students already knew
their results but were still hanging around to meet other people.</p>

<p> "I did better than I expected. I will make it to the science
stream" said Kavita.</p>

<p> "Me too" said Pooja happily. </p>

<p>  Science was the top choice by default.</p>

<p>  "I did very well in Biology" said Kavita. "Look at that a ninety eight
percent score in biology. I must thank Amar for that score. He made
reading about brains rather interesting. They had a whole question on
brains and I am now an expert on brains."</p>

<p>  "Now you can become a brain surgeon" said Pooja. </p>

<p>  In the crowd of friends a few had made it to the science
stream. Others did not. But it did not matter. Everybody was relieved
to have done away with the exams. A few people failed but the mood in
general was a happy one.</p>

<p>  "Let us celebrate. Let us have dinner outside tonight" Kavita said and
everyone agreed. They made necessary plans for the night and everyone
rushed back home. Most homes of Mumbai had no phones and the folks
back home would be eagerly waiting to hear the results.</p>

<p>  "Go get some pedas. We must distribute sweets to the whole
building. Kavita has done very well. Better than expected.  Now she
will become a scientist" Kavita's mother told Sanjay.</p>

<p>  "This year's exam was easier than last year's. People have done quite
well on an average" said Sanjay's friend Dablu.</p>

<p>  "Just because I did better than you Dablu does not mean that
the exams were any easier" said Kavita acting rather proud.
Dablu had always acted very superior to Kavita and suddenly he
did not seem that superior anymore.</p>
 
<p>  "Kavita, just because you got a few points more than Dablu does not
make you better than him. Exams cannot decide such things" Kavita's
mother scolded.</p>

<p>  "I did not start  the topic. He did" said Kavita pointing out the
culprit.</p>

<p>  It was a day of congratulations. Everyone was happy with Kavita's
scores it seemed. Soon it was time for the grand dinner Kavita had
planned. There was pleasant music playing in the background and
everyone was in a real good mood. It was also a time for goodbyes.
Many a face in the crowd that sat around her, Kavita would never see
in her life again. But the girls were not thinking of goodbyes just
then. Kavita looked around her and she was glad that she had so many
friends. Most of the tables in the room were filled with her friends.</p>


<p>  And then somewhere in the last tables she saw Amar. For a minute she
thought she was dreaming. But no, there he was with a glass of beer.
He was surrounded by a few friends and yet he seemed alone.  The drink
in his hands bothered her.  Kavita always found a man with a glass of
alcohol in his hands charming and considered drinking a manly
thing. But why did Amar bother her? Maybe it was in the attitude of
his drinking. There was something sad, something disturbing, almost
punishing about the way Amar was drinking his beer. She almost had the
urge to take the glass away from him and she checked herself. Would
she turn into a nag if she got to know Amar better? The thought was
frightening. Amar intrigued her. Her reactions to him intrigued
her.</p>

<p>  She decided to go and say a hello. It had been a long time and she was
not sure that he would remember her. But he did and he even made place
for her to sit. Kavita told Amar that she was celebrating her board
exam results and that she would be going to Mumbai College of Arts and
Science for further studies. </p>

<p>  "That is where I study too" said Amar.</p>

<p>  That was quite a surprise for both of them. But soon he had nothing
more to say. As usual he was at a loss of words. And there were so
many people around making Kavita very conscious of her
surroundings. Amar began talking to other people.  He seemed quite
comfortable talking to other people. Why was it so easy for him to
talk to other people and not to her? Was there nothing common between
them? Kavita realized that she hardly knew Amar. After sometime it was
time to leave, and Amar got up and left. It was sad to see him
go. Every time he took leave Kavita had thought that was the last she
would see of Amar. But Amar had never left her thoughts nor her
life. Now she would meet him in college again. Honestly she was a
little tired of the emotional turmoil Amar brought in to her life.</p>

<p> Soon dinner ended and Kavita was sad that all her friends had to
 go. Now she had to face a new world. A few people went along with her
 to the same college and she was glad about that. But most people she
 had to let go.</p>

<p> "Why the sad face?" asked Kavita's mother when Kavita got back
home.</p>

<p> "I will not see many of my friends again. I used to see them
everyday. Life is strange. You come to this earth but you can never
posses anything. For one day death will make you leave everything
behind. That rule applies many many times over and over again in so
many stages of your life. It is tiring" said Kavita.</p>

<p> "In a flowing stream, you can only gather the fish that come your
way. The others were not meant for you" said Kavita's mother.</p>
