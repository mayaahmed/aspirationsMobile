<h3> Chapter 11  </h3>
<h2> Settling down </h2>

<p> After two weeks Arti got tired of  living in a motel. </p>

<p> "Living in a motel room means no work for a woman" said Arti.  "The
beds get made, the food is served, and the rooms get cleaned. But I am
feeling homesick. I miss my familiar things. I miss my blue sheets and
my blue blankets. I miss my books and I miss my vessels."  </p>

<p> Kabir switched off the television. </p>

<p> "Now we have so many channels compared to what we had a few years
back but somehow the quality of programs have gone down" said Kabir. </p>

<p> "True. Sometimes less is more" said Arti. </p>

<p> "We will soon find a house, Arti" said Kabir. "I talked to the agent
again today. He will show us some more houses tomorrow. It has been
more than a month since we had a home. I am looking forward to having
a house again. I miss my books too." </p>

<p> The agent took Arti around Bangalore showing her houses to rent. The
apartments of Bangalore were different from Mumbai. Most buildings had
only two floors and the landlords lived in one of the floors. </p>
 
<p> "That house belongs to a film actress. Let us go and see it" said the
agent pointing to a house. </p>

<p> The agent tapped at the gate and soon an old lady came out to open
the gate. </p>

<p> "These people are interested in your apartment. They have come back
from America" said the agent. </p>

<p> "Are you really an actress?" asked Arti. </p>

<p> "Yes, in the old days" said the toothless lady very coyly. </p>

<p> She opened the locked door to the upstairs apartment and showed the house.
Arti went in and looked at the closets and the rooms and she also checked
the bathrooms. </p>

<p> "Always check bathrooms. That is a sign of a clean house" said the lady
laughing. </p>

<p> "I am just looking around. I am not such an expert  in looking for
houses" said Arti embarrassed.  </p>

<p> "No, no. You should make sure everything is to your liking. That is
important" said the old lady. </p>

<p> Arti looked out of the windows and Kabir checked for lighting. </p>

<p> The old woman asked expectantly </p>

<p> "So we make a deal now? Did you like the house?" </p>

<p> "We sure like the house. It is charming. But we need to look at a
few other houses before we make up our mind" said Arti hesitantly. </p>

<p> She felt bad that she could not make up her mind immediately
about the house. </p>

<p>  "Come on in, you must have some tea before you go" said the old lady. </p>

<p> "No, we will come back later for it" said Arti. </p>
 
<p> "I insist, you must come in" said the lady. </p>

<p> The lady made some tea and Arti looked around the apartment. </p>

<p> "So you were an actress? Where are your photographs? What movies
did you act in?" asked Arti. </p>

<p> "I acted in Telugu movies" said the lady and she was hesitant about
showing her photographs. </p>

<p> "Show them some of your old photographs, madam. Madam was a beauty" said
the agent. </p>

<p> "What will you do looking at some old pictures?" asked the lady.
It was clear the old lady was hesitant to go back into her past. </p>

<p> "I will surely like to see them" said Arti enthusiastically. A doubt
formed in her mind that maybe the old lady was not all that great to
look at when she was young. She probably wanted to keep the myth of a
great actress living and did not like to show any of her photographs.
Arti would not have insisted anymore but the old lady slowly brought
out her photographs. The old lady looked beautiful as a young woman
and Arti was shocked at the sad remains of the person in the
photograph in front of her. </p>

<p> "Really nice photographs" said Arti and the woman did not reply. She
almost made a gesture of throwing the photographs in her hand.  </p>

<p> "Do not say anything. I do not look like that anymore. It would have
been better if I did not look like that. Then this old age would have
been easier on me" said the lady as she poured out some more tea.  </p>

<p> When they left the house the agent asked "Did you like the house?"  </p>

<p>  "Yes. We will come back soon" said Arti.  </p>

<p>  "Take your time" said the agent. "Tell me tomorrow which house you
liked."  </p>

<p>  No sooner did the agent leave, a couple of boys came up to
Arti and Kabir and said  </p>

<p>  "Looking for a house to rent? We will show you some good houses sir."  </p>

<p>  "But we already have an agent. We saw some houses and we are making up
our mind" said Kabir.  </p>

<p> "That appa cannot show good houses, sir. Nothing wrong in seeing some more
houses. We will show good houses" insisted the boys.  </p>

<p>  "But we think we like a house already" said Arti.  </p>

<p> "Which house is that?" asked the boys. </p>

<p> "It is owned by an actress" said Arti. </p>

<p> "Oh, no! That lady. She will not give water, sir. Other tenants had
problems with her. She will switch off water supply if you have
guests.  She is a menace. If you don't believe ask some other people,
sir. Promise.  I swear, sir. We will show you good houses, sir. Come
with us, sir. Please, please, sir" said the boys. </p>

<p> Arti and Kabir followed the boys who showed them another set of
houses. Late that night Arti wondered about the old lady and she
asked </p>

<p> "Is it possible that old lady is so mean that she will cut off water
supply if her tenants have guests? She was so beautiful when she was
young. Why does age have to be so cruel?" </p>

<p> Kabir had nothing to say about the lady nor age. It had been an
exhausting day of looking around for houses to rent along with
pressures of handling a new job.  One had to be careful about
landlords. Some of them could be real nasty. </p>

<p> Kabir only said </p>

<p> "Tomorrow we hunt more houses to rent."  </p>

<p> Finally, they found an apartment Arti liked as soon as she entered it.
Arti and Kabir spread out to check the house. When they met again Arti
said </p>

<p> "This is the house I want to rent."  </p>

<p> "I like it too. Come and see the well in the back yard" said Kabir. </p>

<p> "A well? In a city house. That is so cool" said Arti really thrilled. </p>

<p> "Do you use water from this well?" asked Arti to the landlady. </p>

<p> "Rarely to water plants or washing in summer months.  These days there
 is no shortage of water" said the Landlady. </p>

<p>  "It is so cool to have a well in the back yard. I like the doors of
 the house.  I like the shoe brown color they have" said Arti. </p>

<p> "Shoe brown? That's a new color Arti. Which is that color?" asked Kabir. </p>

<p> "I call it shoe brown since the door is the same color of my shoes"
 said Arti. </p>

<p> "I like shoe brown too. We will rent this house. We will call it the
 house with the shoe brown door" said Kabir. </p>

<p> "House with a well rings more of a bell" said Arti. </p>

<p> "Gee! Shoe brown and well bells. What else?" asked Kabir. </p>

<p> "We will move in as soon as possible. I am bored of the motel room and
this house is so nice. I think I want to be here as soon as possible"
said Arti. </p>

<p> The landlady was happy with all the enthusiasm the young couple had
for her house. The landlord brought out the lease papers and said </p>

<p> "So when will you move in?" </p>

<p> "Tomorrow?" asked Kabir and Arti together. </p>

<p> "Sure, if you want to" said the landlord surprised. </p>

<p> The next day Kabir and Arti bought some furniture, a small stove, and
some groceries. Arti cooked a simple meal but the two of them really
enjoyed the home cooked meal. </p>

<p> "I never thought that having a home of your own is so important.
I only realized it after not having a home for a month. One takes
a lot of things in life for granted and you realize its importance
only when you don't have it" said Arti. </p>

<p> The next few days were spend shopping for essential things for the
house. The shops were different from Mumbai and they had to ask around
where cupboards were available or were furniture was available. </p>

<p> "The first things we must buy are curtains for our house. I am sick of
the bedsheets hanging everywhere" said Arti. </p>

<p> They went to the clothes market for buying curtains. There were rows
of shops that sold all sorts of cloth but Arti was shocked at the
prices. </p>

<p> "I never thought that something as basic as curtain cloth could be
so expensive" said Arti. </p>

<p> Finally Arti bought some dark blue cloth which was not that expensive
but she was not exactly happy with the print. </p>

<p> "I guess this should be fine" said Arti gulping as she paid the six
hundred rupees. But soon she forgot the expense and she was in a hurry
to find a tailor. There was a small tailor shop close to where they
lived and Arti told the tailor </p>

<p>"Need to get some curtains stitched quickly. I need it absolutely
quickly. I will pay extra" said Arti. </p>

<p> "Okay, okay, beti (daughter)" said the old man smiling at her
the impatience. "Let us take a look at your house."  </p>

<p> The tailor came over to Arti's house and took the measurements and
details of design for the curtains. He left saying </p>

<p> "I will get you your curtains in two days. Promise." </p>

<p> "Thank you" said Arti. </p>

<p> After two days the old man came with the stitched curtains and asked </p>

<p> "Do you like the curtains?" </p>

<p> Arti looked at the old man's face and she knew she had to praise 
the curtains. He expected it. He had worked hard on having it ready
on time. </p>

<p> "Thank you baba, you did a great job" said Arti and gave him a
twenty rupees extra.  </p>

<p> And soon she put up the curtains and lo! She was surprised at how
ugly they looked. It was a dark blue against the white walls and
the prints were loud. She had a sinking feeling and sat down
dejected. </p>

<p> "I cannot believe I chose such ghastly curtains. These are terrible.
I cannot bear to look at them" said Arti. </p>

<p> "Don't look at them. Read some books instead" said Kabir. </p>

<p> "These curtains are depressing" said Arti again.  </p>

<p> She could not not look at them. All the rooms were covered with that
same ugly fabric and tears swelled in her eyes. But soon she was
distracted with a pleasant sound and it took a few seconds for her to
realize that it was the sound of rain. </p>

<p> "Rains in February. Is that possible?" asked Arti running out to touch
the rain water. </p>

<p> "You will be happy to know that in Bangalore unlike Mumbai it rains
all year. So you have monsoons all year" said Kabir. </p>

<p> "That is just great. I will have my favorite season all year then"
said Arti.  </p>

<p> Arti opened the door of her house and sat at the steps listening to
the rain hitting the black road outside. The swaying of the branches
and the rustling of the leaves in the wind were all pleasant sounds
that brought back memories of childhood days. She took a deep breath
and turned back into the house and to her shock she saw patches of
blue water below the curtains. </p>

<p> "The color runs in this fabric. I cannot believe this is happening
to me" said Arti, her misery now complete. She sat down and
cried. </p>
 
<p> "I might as well put the bedsheets up. I cannot bear to see these
ghastly curtains" declared Arti. </p>

<p> "Don't get excited. Curtains are not the end of the world" said
Kabir a little irritated. </p>

<p> "Easy for you to say. You are not the one spending hours cooped
up in this house" said Arti. </p>

<p> "Just close the windows when it rains. And forget the curtains.
Read a book" said Kabir. </p>

<p> But it was not as easy as that. Arti could not forget the curtains.
She could not make Kabir understand that she could not bear the sight
of the curtains. It jarred and she hated it. She hated that she had
spend so much money and effort on such an ugly sight. She kept wanting
to go away from the house and she did not feel like arranging
anything. </p>

<p> A few days later the movers brought their luggage from Mumbai. Looking
through her things Arti found some old curtains. There were not enough
for all the rooms but enough for a couple of rooms. Arti changed the
curtains of the rooms she frequented and said </p>

<p> "Now I can breathe freely."  </p>

<p> "Grow up" said Kabir. </p>

<p> "Beauty is essential for my survival. A pleasant surrounding is necessary
for my very existence" said Arti. </p>

<p> "Whatever" shrugged Kabir. </p>

<p> When the landlady heard the story about the curtains, she took Arti
shopping and showed her shops where she could buy all sorts of curtain
fabric for a very reasonable price. </p>

<p> "I never thought that these prices were possible" said Arti really
amazed. </p>

<p> "One has to learn. One learns from mistakes. Hundred years back they
invented a piano. You take piano lessons and slowly you learn to
play a piano. Everything takes time to learn but then it is only a
matter of time" said the landlady. </p>

<p> "Pianos were invented a hundred years back?" asked Arti. </p>

<p> "You get the point. Don't you? I did not mean exactly hundred
years back but thereabouts" said the landlady a little upset
about being questioned when she was giving wisdom.  </p>

<p> "Yes, yes. I get the point. Thanks for all your help" said Arti
hurriedly and cursing herself quietly for having asked that question
to the benevolent landlady.  </p>
