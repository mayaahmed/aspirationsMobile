<h3> Chapter 20 </h3>
<h2>Seeking new Roads </h2>

<p> Arti's old school offered her a temporary teaching position. It was
painful to go back to teach mathematics. She did not consider herself
a success story. She was having a hard time. Perhaps she would never
ask another student to become a mathematician. Or perhaps she would
bring about enough changes so that she could tell her students again
that it was cool to be a mathematician. Only time would tell. For now,
it was wise to avoid the question altogether. </p>

<p> Arti had not realized when she signed up for the job that the pay
would be so low. It was almost the same as she got as a graduate
student but now there was no subsidized housing. There was no way any
one could survive on this kind of pay in California. But she signed up
for it and her students were waiting. So she decided to finish this
assignment.   </p>

<p> Instead of traveling by train three hours each way to teach, waking up
at unearthly hours, Arti decided to stay at a friends place. This was
so opposed to her nature but that was the best option. But it turned
out to be a good idea. Arti really got to know her friend. Many of the
safeguards a person adopts when one is outside the house is no longer
there and a real bond is possible. It is also true that the awe you
might have for another person diminishes considerably too.  In a work
environment a person might have skills that no one else has but at
home the person is like everyone else. Arti's friend had come a long
way from a small village in India to California. She had many
interesting stories to tell.  </p>

<p> Arti stayed at her friend's place every night before she taught a
class. Arti cooked and packed some dinner for the night. Her friend
made some delicious meals. They shared their food and had long
conversations. Arti really had a good time. </p>

<p> One of the lessons she learned after her PhD was that it was alright
to ask for help sometimes.  The recent trip to India had taught her
this too. People in India did not always have too much money. But the
culture of sharing and helping was what kept them going at all odd
times.  Keeping one's self pride intact was always a big factor but
friends and relatives were also quite important.  </p>

<p> By now, the US economy had slipped down further. Arti's friends were
all searching for jobs.  To her amusement Arti realized that every
time she was unhappy there were many unhappy people around her. Was
that when she was unhappy, other people opened up about their own
problems?  Moreover, not many people had an agenda of spreading joy in
the world. Finally the teaching assignment came to an end. It was
satisfying to see that students had studied hard and learned
something. </p>

<p> "Look my book is in tatters" a student pointed out to her. </p>

<p> Arti smiled and said </p>

<p> "It is a challenging subject. You need to work hard." </p>

<p> Arti knew that not many teachers could teach like her.  But she would
not return to teach, not for this pittance of a pay. It was a myth
that mathematicians are smart if they were willing to work so hard for
this kind of money.  </p>

<p> "Women do not get along well" said Arti. "They say that Laxmi,
the goddess of wealth, and Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge, will not 
work together. Hence one has to choose between money and knowledge." </p>
 
<p> "Unless you are Kalidas" said Kabir laughing. </p>

<p> "What about Kalidas?" asked Arti. </p>

<p> "He tricked the goddess Kali to grant him both wealth and knowledge"
said Kabir. </p>

<p> "I will emulate Kalidas" said Arti. </p>

<p> It was like Arti had woken up from slumber. A new path she would find
for herself. It now surprised her that she even wanted to spend a
lifetime teaching mathematics.  An era of uncertainty was looming
large. The state of academics seemed obsolete. The very purpose of
academic institutions would be to encourage critical thinking and hold
varied opinions.  Education was getting more and more specialized and
the broader picture was getting lost.  Change was imminent for
academics and for Arti. She now focused on engineering. </p>
