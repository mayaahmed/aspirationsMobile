<h3> Chapter 6  </h3>
<h2>Remnants of Culture  </h2>

<p> Kavita had to stop at the Kerala Samaj to buy some arishtrams (tonics) and
koyumbus (balms) for her mother. </p>

<p> "I like going to the Kerala Samaj. It smells so nice in there" said Pooja.  </p>

<p> Kavita stopped at the little library in the entrance of the building
to return some Malayalam books for her mother. The library smelled of
old books and it was a pleasant smell. There were rows and rows of
Malayalam books bound in a similar way. Kavita walked around looking
at a few books, though she could not read Malayalam. The library was
fascinating because apart from this tiny room, Kavita had not seen
Malayalam books anywhere else.  She felt fortunate that she knew of
the existence of this place otherwise she would not know about the
existence of these books. Malayali authors were churning out books by
the dozens but none of the book stores of Mumbai were selling any
copies. Only English books were visible in the market and maybe a few
stray Hindi books. Many newspaper stalls sold Malayalam magazines but
no books.  </p>

<p> "It makes my soul happy that people of the state of Kerala have
authors that write books. Someday I will read what they have to say.
What do Indian thinkers have to tell us? What are they writing about?
I wish I could read Malayalam well" said Kavita.  </p>

<p> "The school books are bad enough for me. What with learning Hindi and
Marathi I am up to my neck with languages. Please do not wish for
Malayalam in the school curriculum. If you do, I will have to wish to
undo your wish" said Pooja a little alarmed.  </p>

<p> "We learn Hindi and Marathi only for namesake. Can we really read
Hindi literature or Marathi literature? No. I wish I could at least
read Malayalam literature. Malayalam is my mother tongue. I bet there
are a lot of interesting ideas hidden in these volumes of books" said
Kavita.  </p>

<p> "It is fascinating because we do not understand. These alphabets, loud
and clear, are declaring something that we do not comprehend. This is
what is on the minds of our parents perhaps. You realize they are
rather incomprehensible too. By reading Malayalam literature we can
understand what they are thinking" said Pooja.  </p>

<p> "Hmmm, that may be the reason why they are giving us an English education"
said Kavita laughing.   </p>

<p> After the library visit they went to the Ayurveda store. There was a
little line before the prescription counter.  People were talking to
each other and introducing each other. Everyone seemed happy to be
there.  In all of Mumbai, the Kerala Samaj building stood alone in the
service it provided the Malayalis. For Kavita, it was a place where
she tried to understand her roots, her parents, and her ancestors.  </p>

<p> The Ayurvedic center held medicines of all kinds. Some of the
medicines were very bitter, some were very fragrant, and some were
purely delicious.  Kavita's mother had a habit of buying up different
kinds of medicines and made Kavita and her siblings drink them. Her
mother believed that Ayurveda, even if it did not do any good at least
did not do any harm.  She considered it as a part of good parenting to
make children drink medicines whether they were ill or not. As long as
the medicines did not taste awful, Kavita did not mind taking
them. But she never agreed to drink bitter medicines. Kavita
particularly liked the koyumbu she was buying that day. The koyumbu
was for lessening aches and pain and it was made with pure ghee,
sandalwood, and other fragrant ingredients. Kavita applied some
koyumbu on her hands every time her parents used it because she liked
the smell.  </p>

<p> The Samaj organized dance and music classes. Before heading home
Kavita and Pooja watched dance rehearsals for sometime. On the way out
of the building the girls met Vellu who told them about the play that
was going to be enacted in Shanmukananda Hall. </p>

<p> "Remind your parents to buy tickets for the show. I know they always
buy tickets, but remind them anyways. This is a really nice play and
before the play we will have our very own Kuruppu singing songs. Please
remind your parents" he said. </p>

<p> "Sure we will" said Kavita. </p>

<p> When Vellu left Pooja said </p>

<p> "This place is filled with culture maniacs. I am almost sorry that I am
not participating in any of these events."  </p>

<p> "Yes. It plays on one's guilt. Forget these events which is just
traces of a culture. I am guilty of not participating in the very
essence of Malayali culture. That is, I do not consider myself a
Malayali in the true sense. I feel all these things are shows people
are putting up and I am merely a spectator. I am merely a spectator of
the Malayali culture" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "I am like that too" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "In the process of human immigration, there is a constant rejection of
culture. We redefine culture as we understand it. We adopt a potpourri
of the many cultures we are exposed to in Mumbai. This culture has a
character of its own. But at the same time we are rejecting the
beliefs of our ancestors in one generation making our choices hard and
confusing. In some sense I feel culturally deprived and I feel like a
gypsy" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "The exams are really near" said Pooja a little worried. </p>

<p> "Yes. Exams that will decide our lives, they say" said Kavita. </p>

<p> "I hope we get into the science stream. I hope we get enough percentage
of marks to get admissions to a good college" said Pooja. </p>

<p> "One strives as much as one can. I cannot push myself beyond what my
character has intended me to do. If science is for me, then I will
make the science stream effortlessly and elegantly. If not, then
of course we know that the universe still extends beyond the
stars. There is something else out there for me. What is there for me
in the immediate future is the million dollar question. And
unfortunately astrology is not good enough to answer that question"
said Kavita. </p>

<p>  "The future is what it maybe, but the present is to stare at a pile
of books" said Pooja. </p>

<p>  "So it is. The present is rather boringly clear" said Kavita. </p>

<p>  Pooja took out a laddoo from her bag and offered it to Kavita. </p>

<p> "Here, eat a laddoo. We got it from our trip to the Tirupathi temple. They
are the best laddoos in the world." </p>

<p> "I cannot" said Kavita. "It is the Lent season. I give up sweets for
  forty days. I agree these laddoos sure are the best laddoos in the
  world."  </p>

<p> "Really? You cannot eat laddoos in Lent?" asked Pooja.  </p>

<p> "It is a season of abstinence. I usually give up eating sweets. Some
people give up smoking, others give up eating meat. It is a personal
choice.  But the idea is that one must sacrifice something" said
Kavita.  </p>

<p> "And you just gave up Tirupathi laddoos. It is abstinence indeed" said Pooja
laughing.  </p>

<p> "Also I go to church every day this week. This week is good Friday week.
There is mass and novenas everyday" said Kavita.  </p>

<p> "Are you going to the Matunga church?" asked Pooja.  </p>

<p> "No, to our colony's church" said Kavita. "The Malayali church. The
prayers are all in Malayalam. The whole mass is musical.  I do not
know the songs. But they sound very nice and touching."  </p>

<p> "Your talk makes me want to visit temples. I don't go that often to
temples" said Pooja philosophically.  </p>

<p> Kavita was a little late when she reached the church. She found a vacant
seat in the front benches and went and sat there. She looked around and
found her mother on her knees, praying. Her mother nodded acknowledging
her presence.  </p>

<p> Kavita started walking along with the little crowd in the church as
they stopped in front of different portraits of Christ which pictured
the fourteen stations in the way of the cross. The songs they sang in
church that day were all sad songs. The sufferings described in the
songs were more general than the sufferings of Christ. Kavita's heart
was heavy at the end of the mass and she fought back tears that were
appearing in her eyes time and again.  </p>

<p> Then it was time for the novena. And they started to sing "Nitya
sahaya mathe" which was a prayer to Mary asking her to pray for her
children.  For Kavita, this song was like a call from her ancient
past. This was among the few Malayalam songs she had heard before.  On
her trips to Kerala, she had heard this song every night. Her rural
family gathered together every evening after dinner and in the light
of kerosene lamps (for there was no electricity in the villages)
prayed for almost an hour. In Mumbai homes the evening prayers were a
rare occasion, but almost all the families Kavita visited in Kerala
prayed in the evenings. And they always ended the prayers with the
song Nitya sahaya mathe. </p>

<p> The song struck a chord in Kavita's soul. It was touching to
see her grand parents, her parents, her aunts, uncles, cousins, and
siblings on their knees praying to some mother in heaven asking to
pray for them.  It made human kind look so vulnerable. Somehow the
faces of adults appeared very worried and helpless as they sang this
song. And it was only during the Good Friday week that she heard this
song in Mumbai. It was a very similar scene with so many adults on
their knees looking very vulnerable as they asked Mary to pray for the
thousands of hurting souls. </p>

<p> Kavita turned around to look for her mother again.  Her mother was on
her knees in a white sari, the pallu covering her head, her eyes
closed, singing along with the crowd. Her mother was not a good singer
and the thought made Kavita smile. But the sight of her mother
reassured her. Her mother, proud, wise, and strong was on her knees and
praying but that would pass. She would be strong and assuring
again. It did not matter whether the world had a mother in heaven or
not, it was enough that Kavita had a mother on earth. She thanked god
quickly for that. </p>
